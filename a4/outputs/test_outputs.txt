You know that what I do is to write for the kids, and, indeed, I'm probably the author for children, more read in the United States.
And I always say to people that I don't want to look like a <unk>
Now I would argue, as a consultant, or with clothing and clothing and nobody has chosen a <unk>
Today I'm here to tell you about circles and <unk>
And you know that a <unk> is not something that came up in some way.
You just have to go back to your name for you as a <unk> <unk>
That is the painting of a <unk>
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is the kind of complicated form of which I'm going to talk to you about you.
My circle started in the years -- in the middle school in New York City, where I was the classic <unk>
So when you go to <unk> every week in the bathroom of dinner, until a teacher had saved my life.
She saved my life to get to the <unk> of the emergency room of their friends.
I was doing it in <unk>
for three years, three years ago.
And I had to go out of the city.
He had a habit, and about 85 dollars, and ended up in San Francisco, California -- I found a <unk> -- and in the years, I felt the need to start working in organizations who were struggling to work in organizations that were killed against war.
About three or four years ago, I got a phone call from that <unk> the lady -- the lady <unk> who said, <unk> <unk>
I'm <unk> that of adults we never get to <unk>
You could go back to Pittsburgh and please find that man who I know you haven't seen before.
And I have to tell you that I have breast cancer and I would like you to do it with this for granted.
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
So we were going to see, we were going to see, and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We find a place, and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> of their family, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was possible.
This is something we knew how to do.
And as the woman who wanted to be <unk> as the adult came to <unk> it became a <unk> and it was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle was formed in a circle -- and that one that I told you about was actually the right thing to do.
The reason is that death is part of life.
And she saved my life, my partner and I put them out of it.
And you know that that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy that today I was talking about this.
It also needs -- it needs to respect love and <unk> and it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important for me.
Through my job, I'm trying to express that humans are not aware of nature and that everything is happening.
I went for the first time to Antarctica about 10 years ago, and I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk> I was <unk>
My heart can be <unk> trying to understand what I was in front of me.
The <unk> to my <unk> of the water almost 60 feet, and I couldn't think that it was about a <unk> <unk> on the other side of the building.
The <unk> are born in <unk> when it comes to the glaciers or the barriers of <unk>
Every one of you has their own personality <unk>
They have a different way to interact with their environment and their <unk>
Some of them are <unk> and they go back to the end, whereas other ones cannot be <unk> more and more <unk> in a <unk> <unk>
So it's easy to think, when you see a <unk> that are isolated together, and as we see ourselves as we look at ourselves as a human being.
But the reality is that it's all the opposite.
And as you go through a <unk> I'm driving your atmosphere and <unk>
And as you go back to the <unk> it releases water, water in minerals that feeds many forms of life.
I would go back to photograph these <unk> as if it was about the portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these moments there exist in this way and not going to exist in that way again.
It's not the death of the death when it comes to the end, but a third of his way through the entire life.
And part of the ice on the ice of the <unk> which is very <unk> it has a couple of years.
And another part of the ice has more than 100 years ago.
The last pictures that I would like to show you about a <unk> I photographed in <unk>
It's a little bit <unk> and I actually get a <unk>
Here it is.
You can see on the left a little <unk>
It was about five meters away.
And I would like you to pay attention to the shape of the <unk> and your <unk> line of <unk>
You can see here, it begins to <unk> the boat has moved to the other side and the man is there to <unk>
This is a <unk> <unk>
<unk> of the water about 120 meters or 40 miles.
This video is in real time.
And so <unk> <unk> is a different side of her mother.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, every one of a <unk>
So two couples every one of a sudden with a <unk>
I don't want you to be <unk> too in the details, because if you go to thinking about that, I don't get to pay attention.
Think about it for a minute.
And in this stage, I want you to imagine that, in a case, the chromosome itself takes the X X of the <unk>
And in the other case, the X chromosome became the X X of <unk>
Both of them, and it becomes life.
So let me talk about them more quickly.
In my open activity to make two <unk>
In one of my work with the story of <unk>
I'm a <unk> by training and what study in this case is the way people <unk> the anatomy of human bodies and <unk> how they have considered the idea of the <unk> what they have thought about the body.
The other role that performance in my work is <unk> as <unk> of patients or, as I say sometimes, <unk> <unk> <unk> of people who are <unk>
In this case, I've been working with people whose physical characteristics of physical forms and social norms and social problems.
I've been working for example, for example, with twins -- two people inside the same body.
I've been working with people with <unk> people much more low than the same way.
And I've been working with many cases of people with sex <unk> individuals whose physical physics does not operate in the <unk> <unk> and <unk>
In the <unk> we can <unk>
The <unk> has a lot of different ways.
I'm going to give you some examples of some examples of having an sex that doesn't exist in the common forms or something.
For example, the case is the case of the individual basis with <unk> <unk> which means <unk> <unk> and says to the <unk> that we all have in the life of <unk>
And then, in the life of the <unk>
But because this individual <unk> <unk> the body doesn't respond to the same way.
It's the <unk> of <unk>
So there are high levels of <unk> but without <unk>
As a result, the body is communicating with a course of <unk>
So when you <unk> your baby has the <unk>
It's a <unk> it's grown as a <unk>
And often, it's not because of puberty, when it's growing and developing <unk> but it doesn't have the case -- when someone realizes that something is going to be a <unk>
And then you can see <unk> you realize that instead of having <unk> and <unk> it actually has <unk> and a little <unk>
So the important thing to understand is that you can think that it is a man, but it's actually not as well.
Women like men, like men, we have in the body and called <unk> <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
The <unk> glands produce <unk> <unk> <unk>
The majority of women like me -- I think a woman <unk> is not known as his structure -- I think it will be a typical woman most of the women as I are <unk>
And I would say, and we need to do it.
As a result, someone like me have the most exposed brain to the <unk> that the woman who was born with <unk> which has the <unk> of <unk>
That's why sex is something -- it's not that the <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in a way they can be in all <unk>
Another example, a few hundred years ago, I got a call from a boy called <unk> and raised as <unk> and raised as <unk> and sexual relationships with it, carried a life as a boy and just trying to figure out that I had <unk>
It had a extreme form of disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And it was the <unk> and in <unk> the <unk> glands were so strong that essentially created an industrial environment that essentially created an industrial process.
And as a result, their aspiration were <unk> his brain was exposed to the <unk> of the <unk>
He was born with one of the <unk> no <unk> no <unk>
And it was about 19 years ago when I started having trouble in the <unk> <unk> when doctors found that, in fact, it was women on the ground.
Well, another example of a <unk> case of <unk>
Some people with <unk> <unk> they develop what's known as <unk> and they have <unk> tissue, followed in <unk> tissue, <unk>
We don't know why it happens to be it.
So there's a lot of <unk>
The reason that children with this type of bodies -- they will be <unk> or <unk> or <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> is not so much of a better health, but the reason is that we have a better health education.
In many cases people are perfectly connected to the <unk>
The reason is that the <unk> in various surgeries is that they're a threat to our social categories of social categories of social categories of social categories of social categories of social categories of social categories of social categories of social categories of social categories of social categories of social categories of social categories of social categories of social categories of social phenomena.
So the system is based on the idea that a particular anatomy has a <unk> identity for you.
We have the idea that being woman is having to be <unk> <unk> <unk> as black as being black in terms of <unk>
So a little bit more interesting.
And when it comes to us, it shows something quite different, we have problems with <unk> <unk> problems with <unk>
So we have very <unk> ideas in our culture about <unk> <unk>
Our nation is based on a concept of <unk>
So imagine the amazing thing that is going to have children who are born like two people inside the same body.
The most recent case is the last year with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> put in <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> of <unk>
A lot of journalists were called <unk> and they said, "What are they going to do to determine whether <unk> <unk> is man or <unk>
And I had to explain to the journalists who don't have such a <unk>
In fact, now we know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't exist, a <unk> between men and women and women and women and <unk> and <unk> and we are ourselves who we call that line.
So what we have is a situation where the most important science, most we have to admit that these categories were we thought of these categories of <unk> we thought they were kind of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> are much more <unk> than <unk>
And not only in terms of <unk>
It's also in terms of race, something that it turns out to be much more complicated than the <unk> <unk>
So as we can see, we put ourselves in a <unk>
<unk> for example, the fact that we share the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with the <unk>
What would you <unk> the fact of the fact of them in just a few <unk>
And as we <unk> in the science of us, we get more in an ideal area where we have to recognize the categories of <unk> which are probably too <unk>
And we're looking at this in all the way of human life.
One of them, for example, in our democratic culture in the United States in the United States -- are at the beginning and at the end of life.
It's hard to reduce a moment from which a body becomes human and it has different rights to the <unk>
There are arguments that are very <unk> today today -- not in public, but I know within the <unk> about when someone gets <unk>
Our ancestors had never had to do with this question of whether someone was too sick and their lives.
As a lot of you put a pen in front of your nose, and if you were still not going to do it.
If I was going to move it out.
But today we can, for example, to extract organs from a body and put them in another body.
And as a result, we need to understand the prisoner's dilemma that the death of nothing, and this brings us in a hard situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And maybe you think that this explosion of categories might be like I was talking about somebody as I was talking about.
In politics I'm <unk> <unk> people with different bodies -- but I have to admit that I would admit that I would admit that I would never forget it.
<unk> that these categories are much more powerful than what we thought of myself as a <unk>
<unk> from the point of view.
And to tell you about this tension first, I have to admit that I'm a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were <unk> but they were <unk>
I mean, they were so excited and so <unk> and so <unk> in what they do, I find that I would see that musical music, and not by the music, which is totally <unk>
It's because of what happened in <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk>
The <unk> <unk> <unk> for me, the first artists of the anatomy and I asked about why.
What they <unk> it was a <unk> concept, and it would be the other thing that was a radical and beautiful and beautiful and <unk>
And as all of you remember, what we would <unk> our <unk> <unk> was the idea of <unk> <unk> was in a very <unk> concept of <unk>
The monarchs of the old world didn't know the DNA, but they had clear the right idea of the right thing.
They had the concept of blood of <unk>
They were the idea that it was to be able to be able to be able to make the political power of the grandfather to the father and then to child, and then to son, and she said, <unk>
The <unk> <unk> <unk> that idea and put it for a new concept of <unk> and that concept was that all men are created the same thing.
They <unk> the field of game and they decided that the anatomy that mattered in common and not important differences -- that was something very important.
And in part they were doing because it was part of a <unk> system where they were <unk> two things.
It was <unk> democracy and at the same time in the same time.
And it's very clear, if you look at the story of the <unk> <unk> which many were very interested in science and in the idea of a <unk> world.
They were <unk> from <unk> <unk> and by so many <unk> the concept of being able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to make a <unk>
They were moving towards a <unk> concept of <unk>
And if you look back for example, the <unk> of <unk> talking about nature and the <unk> of the universe.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
So the power of nature to tell you who we are.
And indeed, we were getting the idea of <unk> <unk>
And in doing so, they were <unk> the foundations of the future of <unk> <unk>
We don't think about that way, but they did it for us and it was very interesting.
And what happened years ago.
And women <unk>
Then it came to the success of the Civil Rights movement, with people from the <unk> of <unk> <unk> who said, "I am a <unk>
We found men in the streets of the Civil Rights movement, saying, "I am a <unk>
And again, people of the color that we get to <unk> <unk> about the difference -- and, again, <unk>
We see the same with the <unk> of <unk>
The problem is, of course, that as we look at the <unk> we have to start asking why we keep certain <unk>
But attention -- I want to keep some <unk> in our culture.
For example, I don't want to give you a fish the same rights that a human rights to a human being.
I don't want to say that we should be able to do it.
I don't want to say that the children of five years would allow them to have sexual relationships or <unk>
There are some <unk> <unk> that for me -- and I think we should do it.
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why if they have a sense of sense.
Well, let's go back to those two things, at the beginning of this stuff.
We have two <unk> both <unk> and in the middle, exactly the same day.
So let's imagine that one of them, they were born three months before the one of the one of the one of the <unk>
In the contrary, he was born in <unk> was born in <unk> was born in <unk>
For the only fact that there was born three months before Mary came up with all the rights of three months before Henry <unk> the right treatment, the right to <unk> the right to <unk> the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for everything that it's not because it has a biological age, but because he was born again.
We found other <unk> in relationship to their <unk>
In order to be considered a man as well as I haven't told you, if it is <unk> in virtue of being considered a man in the middle of the <unk> <unk> of the <unk>
You know, for your part, you don't have the same rights to marriage that Henry <unk> for example, for example.
Henry can read in all the states with a woman, but Mary can read it with a woman just in some <unk>
So there are still <unk> categories that in various ways they are <unk> and <unk>
And now the question is: What do we do now that science would put so much in the field of anatomy that we get to the point of having to admit that a democracy is <unk>
I don't want to give science to science, but at the same time sometimes I feel like science is going to make it happen.
So where does it work?
It seems that what happens in our culture is a sort of attitude to <unk> "Well, we need to put the line anywhere in some part so that we're going to do it.
But a lot of people left up in a position like this.
For example, Texas in a certain time has decided that to get married with a man you don't have to have ingredients and that to marry one woman with a woman in the <unk>
Now, in the practice they don't do both.
But this is also very strange that the story I told you at the beginning of the <unk> of <unk>
If you look at one of the parents of the modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther Martin Luther King, in his <unk> "I <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
She says that we should pay people to be <unk> not in the color of their skin, but in the content of their <unk> going beyond the <unk>
And I want to say, "Yes, the idea seems to be very good.
But in practice, how does it work?
How would people pay people at the basis of their <unk>
I mean, I want to point out that I'm not sure that we should be <unk> in this for <unk> rights to people, because I've got to admit that I know that I know that I know more than the social services that I know.
I also want to say that maybe some <unk> that I know can make more decisions -- smart decisions about their sexual relationships that I know.
So how to put the subject of the content of <unk>
It turns out that it turns out very fast.
And one part of me is what would happen if the character of a person could actually be measured with an instrument, perhaps with a <unk> <unk>
We want to get to that point.
I'm not sure where we go.
And what I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States will continue to develop this opportunity of thinking in terms of democracy.
We've done a good job in corruption, and I think we're going to make a good job in the future.
We don't live for example, in a context like the Iranian where a man who feels like a man who feels like the other young men are willing to be -- unless he's willing to be willing to be willing to be able to do it.
We are not in that level.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context like the surgeon who I talked about a couple years ago that there were actually a couple of years ago that there were actually <unk>
But when the phone asked him the reason he asked him the reason he had a very <unk> operation, he told me that in that other country these children would be very <unk> and so I had to do it.
So what she said, "Well, it has been the politician who has been considered the political revolution.
So the United States has tremendous implications to people to be who are not <unk> to change the <unk>
So I think we have to be in your head.
Well, to end I want to say that I've been talking a lot of <unk> <unk>
And I want to think about how it would be democracy, or as I could have been, if we had given greater participation to <unk>
And I want to say something a little bit radical for a node, and that is that I think you can have different ideas from different <unk> <unk> in particular if there are people thinking in war.
Since a few years, since I've been interested in <unk> I've also been interested in looking at the difference here.
And one of the things that I've been interested in is the differences between men and women in the way of thinking and operate in the world.
And what we know from <unk> studies is that women in average, don't all, but in <unk> tend to pay more attention to social relationships and worry about those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have a very interesting situation in our lives.
And years ago, when I was at Princeton one of my sudden I knew that I was interested in feminism -- I was like, <unk> like <unk> made me <unk>
<unk> what has the <unk> <unk>
And I thought, "This is the best question I've ever experienced before.
<unk> you have to see it with <unk> <unk> and so there is nothing female in the <unk>
But the more the more I thought about his question, the most successful thing in the <unk>
I mean, that might be something different between the human brain, and the male that makes us more <unk> to social relationships and willing to help the most <unk>
So if the <unk> were very lucky to find the way to protect people for the state, is possible that there would be more <unk> to this concept, perhaps we would have released the concept of protection with the <unk>
And perhaps that is what we need to do in the future when we get democracy beyond the <unk> thinking about the body body, in terms of your identity and think more in terms of life.
So as we try to create a more perfect, let's think about what we do on the other side.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
In the year 2007, I decided that we had to focus on how we think about global development.
Our new goal should be that when every family think where they want to go to live and work, have the chance to choose between least a bunch of different cities that are willing to attract new <unk>
Well, at this point, we're far from that point of view.
There are thousands of millions of people in developing developing developing developing developing developing developing developing developing countries.
But the amazing thing about cities is that it would be a lot more than their cost of <unk>
So we could easily be <unk> to the world -- perhaps a lot of new cities.
Well, this might sound enough, if you've never thought about new cities.
But just <unk> by the <unk>
So imagine that half of those who would like to live in small apartments were already feeding and that the other half still had to go back to it.
You could try to increase the ability to put <unk> in all the urban buildings in all the urban buildings in all marine cities.
But you know that the problem that is <unk> is that these buildings and areas that are surrounding them have rules to avoid <unk> and <unk>
So it would be very hard to do all those <unk>
But they might go to a completely new, building a completely new building building again, and when the rules of that place are going to be able to put <unk> instead of putting <unk>
So I proposed that civil governments are building new areas of corruption, big, large cities and I gave them a cities in <unk>
Later I found out that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of success.
Did you know that every year about 75 percent of 75 percent of your country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask them what they could do to make sure that those same people could stay and make those same things.
In the summer of 2009, <unk> spent by a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In the next 18 years, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with a platform in which <unk> reforms and at the same time.
He asked him to <unk> who was his head of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk in <unk>
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a huge amount of trials with users, tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> to their own ideas, more <unk>
The first point was the importance of the rules, like those rules that tell you that you can't go and go to all the traditional residents in Italy.
So we were doing a lot of attention to new technologies, but it takes so much technology as possible to <unk> and usually are the rules that we keep going.
At the end of the 2010, a friend of mine sent me to <unk> a link with the <unk>
He showed him to <unk>
They don't know.
I said, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we met in <unk> in a room of a <unk>
I tried to explain to you this point about what the cities, which are the cities, much more valuable than its cost than its cost than its cost for its cost than its cost than its cost for its cost than its cost for its cost than its cost for its cost than its cost for its cost than its cost for its cost than its cost for its cost
And I used this image that shows the value of the <unk> in a place like New York <unk> which in some cases, the thousands of dollars per square per square meter.
But it was a very powerful discussion and at some point, when there was a boca, Galvao." said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the talk <unk>
And the talk described in terms of very simple terms that a city under <unk> is a place where it begins with <unk> <unk> a <unk> that <unk> the rules that would be <unk> there and a choice for people would want to go under those <unk>
So the president of <unk> I said, and he told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this might be the way that our country works.
He asked me to be a <unk> and I talk about the four and five of the <unk>
So I introduced another talk full of data, which is a picture like this, which was to explain to you that for <unk> a lot of value to a city, this has to be very small.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
And just this evening it weighs over 100 miles per square inch.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, you have to start with a site that would take at least one of the least one <unk>
That's more than 100,000 dollars.
All the world <unk>
The faces of the audience were very happy and <unk>
The leader of the Congress came up to the platform and said, <unk> many because of his talk, but maybe we could see the video of the talk <unk>
I have here in my <unk>
So I sat down and showed the <unk>
And this is what it looks like a new city can offer new choices for people.
It would be an option of a city where you could go in a <unk> instead of hundreds of thousands of miles away to the United States.
And also <unk> new choices for them to help them.
Because the leaders of the government of <unk> would have help help help help be to benefit from the countries that they were going to establish and make the rules of the <unk> so that they all could rely on the <unk>
We went and we saw a <unk>
This picture is there. This picture is there.
I could be able to make a few thousand miles away.
And shortly after the 19, the 19 of January, they voted in Congress to make it a <unk> and by adding a <unk> <unk> which would allow to create these special regions of the universe.
In a country that had just been through this financial crisis in Congress to favor of this <unk> <unk> it was <unk>
They all know all the things in society, the <unk>
By <unk> in the <unk> you have to go back two times in the United States.
The February of February came over again in another <unk> of <unk>
And after the <unk> of the <unk> at 24 of February, a number of about 30 <unk> was the two places in the world that are more interested in living in developing cities.
One of them is North Korea in the <unk>
This is a picture of a new city in the city that is building in North Korea, which is much bigger than the center of Africa.
All you see there was actually built in four years after the four years to get the <unk>
The other country in developing cities is <unk>
In fact, they've already built two cities in China and they're going to go to a <unk>
And if you think about this, this is the point where we are.
They have a website, and they're already thinking about a site for the second city.
They are doing a legal system that would allow them to be <unk> and once it would be able to operate under a <unk>
A country has already committed to allow the Supreme Court to be the proportion of this new solar system.
And there are <unk> and collaborators who are very interested in the project.
You can even get some of them to be a <unk>
But the only thing we know that we know that they have a good number of things.
There's a lot of companies that you want to get in the <unk> especially in a place with a free zone and there's a lot of people who would like to go to live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say that I would like to give you a look at another place.
There's a million year that comes from Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who are parents who have to leave back to her family to go to get a job, sometimes they have the money to get money to just eat or buy <unk>
Meanwhile, sometimes there's children who are trying to get their parents with their parents who haven't seen, in a decade.
So what seems like to think about building a new city in <unk>
Or build a dozen this, or a hundred of these all over the world.
What does it seem to be to think about <unk> so that families can choose between various cities that are willing to attract new <unk>
This is an idea that is worth spreading.
And my friends were asked me to say, "Thank you very much.
I'm a <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what there are inside, I'm going to make a public moral philosopher, and that's that, I live with the <unk>
I love to find, and most recently, photograph and put on my blog, and put it on my blog, <unk> <unk> and different <unk>
But I didn't know anything new.
All my clothes is from the second hand of <unk> and <unk>
Oh, thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
The second hand will allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment, and in my <unk>
And I would be able to meet people in the general general of all my money -- my favorite thing is <unk> and buy it in my search search for <unk>
I mean, what I'm going to do is to find out why.
I'm going to be my <unk>
I like the <unk>
cost less than 20 dollars.
If all the answers are <unk> so I feel that I've got to make it <unk>
Going back to the subject of my <unk> I want to tell you what I <unk> for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what does it mean by someone who has all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what it looks like.
I've got seven pairs of clothing and nothing more.
And so I would put inside a week is all I put in my <unk>
I thought it would be able to find everything else I would like to use after you get here to <unk> <unk>
And because I don't know like the woman who walks at TED --  -- that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the data for this week.
It doesn't sound either.
As I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that, believe it or not, I've learned in this adventure of not using clothing <unk>
Let's start with it.
And I call it <unk>
You don't have to spend a lot of money to see you.
All you can always see for less than 50 dollars.
All the together, including the <unk> I took me <unk> and it was the most expensive that I've used in the week.
<unk> the color is <unk>
It is almost impossible to be in bad humor, when you're wearing a red car.
If you're happy, you're willing to attract other people hate other people.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
I just know that.
If you go out of the <unk> people are not just going to give you a <unk>
<unk> <unk> of the child that you see here.
Sometimes people say that it seems to me that it seems to be the <unk> or I remember her a little seven years ago.
I like to <unk> and say, <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
If you think you look at it with something, it is almost sure that it would be <unk>
And if you think that you don't look at it, it's probably not enough.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until the 30 years that I really understood his life.
And I'm going to show you a few <unk> in a few <unk>
If you believe that you're a beautiful person in your inside and open, you don't see that you can't <unk>
So there are no excuse for no one of this stuff.
We have to be able to get everything we want to be able to do to get it to the other we want to be.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
So a universal truth six words for you. The <unk> will come up with it.
And finally, <unk> <unk> <unk> and only a very cool way to tell the world something about you without having to say a little bit about it.
I've tested one and again, when people came to me, this week simply because of what I was doing, and we had conversations called <unk>
All of this is not going to go on my little <unk>
So before I went to Brooklyn, he was going to make sure that they would give it out.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn this week is that you have to leave certain things.
I don't need <unk> <unk> of these things, because at the right time, there will be another <unk> <unk> and brilliant <unk> if there's a little bit of love in my heart and <unk>
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can split in two things.
On the side side, the one side of that is the thing and the right side that is the <unk>
So if you take a scale to measure the <unk> of every <unk> we could design a <unk> of our brain.
For example, this would be someone who is completely different.
This would be someone who is totally <unk>
So where do you <unk> your brain in this <unk>
Some <unk> for one of these big, but I think for most of the <unk> of this audience, your brain is something that -- with a lot of <unk> in the same time.
It's not that they're a <unk> <unk>
You can be <unk> and <unk>
I think one of those people, that as most of the other physical physical physicists -- we need quite a logic to <unk> these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need quite a lot of intuition to make the experiments that we really need.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, how do we develop this <unk>
We put them to play with them and then we see as <unk> and then we developed our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do it.
But I knew that you might have developed with the <unk> of the years that one thing that says that one thing can be just a place to the time.
I mean, it might sound like a thing is in two different places at the same time, but you were not born with this <unk> <unk>
I remember looking at a child playing in a bar of <unk>
It was a small child, and I didn't do it very well, because I was always <unk>
But I bet the play with that bar was taught a secret lesson, and it is that the big things don't allow the <unk> and that being in a place like this.
This is a great model model that you can have in the world, except that you are a physical physicist from <unk>
It would be a terrible model for a matter of particles, because they don't play with them with these strange <unk> play with these strange <unk>
And when they play with their particles, they discover that they do all kinds of things -- like they can go walls, or they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then we wrote all these observations, and we call theory theory theory of quantum mechanics and <unk>
In that point it was the physical physics of the quantum mechanics to describe those little <unk>
But it doesn't matter to describe the big objects that all around us all the time.
That is not a very good thing to myself, and perhaps it's because it doesn't matter very often with <unk>
Well, sometimes play with them, but not a lot.
And I've never seen that.
I mean, you never saw a <unk>
But it doesn't really work well in my life.
Because if everything is made out of small particles and all the small particles have all the principles of quantum mechanics, then I shouldn't keep the principles of <unk> <unk>
I don't find the reason why I don't know.
And so I would be much better if I could somehow show that a common object also continues to all the principles of quantum mechanics also <unk>
This is why a few years ago, I asked you to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object that you can see that has been in a <unk> of <unk> <unk>
So what we see here is a little chip on the computer, and what we see here is a small chip camera.
And you can try to see the green point in the way.
That is the piece of metal that I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the <unk>
And here's what I'm going to show you a little bit about the <unk>
And then here we do a very big approach to the small <unk> of <unk>
So what we see is a little bit of metal, with <unk> and that <unk> <unk> in a kind of way.
And so I did this almost the same way that you could put a computer chip on the computer, and so I could make a computer computer.
I went to a <unk> room, again, and I got to work all the big machines for about 100 dollars, for 100 years.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> which is under the <unk>
This device has the ability to be in an industrial crisis, but for it it needs a little bit of <unk>
Let me make a <unk>
You know what it is, which is to be in a basement full of people.
I mean, when I'm in a grocery store, I do all kinds of things, but then when other people are going to leave those things, because I don't want to be <unk> or, really, <unk>
The quantum mechanics says that the objects we have, the same way.
The ones of the <unk> objects are not only people, it's also the light that happens in and the wind that happens to your side and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little piece of metal -- it would have to be the mechanics of all the other <unk>
And that was what we did.
And I would put the pieces and then you put them into the air, and then you put it into a temperature of a degree of a degree for a degree on the top of the surface.
Now, as being in the <unk> the small piece of metal is free of act as <unk>
So we measured their <unk>
So we found out that it was very <unk> in different ways.
Instead of being perfectly <unk> And the way that we <unk> it was like a breath of this shape -- like a <unk> which is broken, and you get <unk>
And to give you a little bit of <unk> <unk> we were able to do that, and we didn't get it at the same time -- something that only happens with <unk>
And so what I'm telling you is that it is really important.
What means that a <unk> thing and not <unk> at the same time?
Think about <unk>
In a way, all the carbon dioxide that you take that piece of metal are getting down, and at the same time those same atoms are moving up and so on.
It's only in <unk> <unk> when those are <unk>
In the rest of the time they're <unk>
That means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which means that the whole piece of metal is in two different places in two different places.
I think this is interesting.
Why?
<unk> <unk> <unk> in a <unk> room to do this for all those years. Because look at this, the difference in the scale of a single metal is more or less the exact same thing that the difference between that piece of metal and you.
So if you just take a just to be in two different places at the same time, and that piece of metal can be in two different places, why don't you be in two different places.
I mean, this is my logic that I <unk>
So imagine if you were in several places at the same time, how would it be that?
So how do you put your consciousness if your body was <unk> in the way.
There's another part of the story.
And it is when it comes to the <unk> and we look at the lights and we look inside the box, we saw that metal left there in a <unk>
And I could get this new challenge, apparently all the objects in the mail actually are just the ones that are simply <unk> in a small space.
You hear a lot about what quantum mechanics tells us that everything is happening.
Well, that's not so <unk>
It's more than that, it's more interesting.
This is that those connections, your connections to all the things that you are, literally define who you are, and that's the deep space of the mechanics of quantum mechanics in the <unk>
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months later, another work at Google, until I put the idea of doing something related to conservatives and art to my head that is here and allowed me to take it to it.
It took me 18 months and a few months ago.
A lot of stories and stories, you know, with 17 clinical trials in nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on the <unk>
There's a lot of stories from why we did that, we did.
I think my own story is explains just about this slide and this is the case.
I grew up in India, I grew up in India.
And I would say a great education -- I don't have access to many of these neighborhoods and works of art.
So so when I started traveling and I started to learn a lot.
And working at Google, I try to make the desire to make it more accessible by technology.
So we formed a team -- a great team of people, and we started doing this.
What I'm going to show you a demo for then to tell you a couple of interesting things that we've been working on from their <unk>
So we were going to <unk>
Look around all the museums that we call <unk>
It's the history of <unk> the <unk> the <unk>
In fact, I'm going to go in one of my favorite numbers, the museum of New York.
There are two ways of doing this -- very much.
And we click and <unk> we are already inside of it.
It doesn't matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that actually doesn't exist, it doesn't matter.
You're going to go down there and get them back and put them down there and get them back and <unk>
You want to navigate the <unk>
We put it back and with one of the things that we put in.
They are inside that want to go at the end of the tree.
They go back to the <unk> which is <unk>
<unk> <unk>
Thank you. But I haven't come to do it.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings paintings -- <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
I see the <unk> <unk>
If the museum shows us the picture, you can click there.
See, this is one of the things. This is one of those.
Here is all the information of <unk>
So for those of you who are truly interested in art, you can click -- but I'm going to do this right now right now.
And this is one of the images that we've shown on what we call <unk> <unk> <unk>
So this picture, for example, <unk> I think, about 10,000 million dollars.
And there are many people who say, "What do you get with 10,000 million <unk>
So I'm going to show you what you actually get with 10,000 billion dollars.
You can do it in a very simple way.
You see things that are happening in the <unk>
I love this guy, his expression doesn't have to save their lives.
But if you really want to be <unk>
So I started to play, and I found myself with something that was coming there.
And I said, "Well, this seems to be <unk>
And I watched the kids were actually playing something.
It was a little bit, I spoke with some people from the <unk> and I actually discovered that this is a game called <unk> which is a <unk> with a chicken in <unk>
And it was very interesting.
I don't know why they do, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to be able to get more into depth and you'll see that you can actually get it even to the <unk>
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to show you the picture, so you'll see what it looks like.
So here is where we were, and this is what the video is <unk>
The best thing is to go back a little bit.
So now we're going to go back to jump again, in New York City.
Here's another of my favorite <unk> "The night <unk>
The example that I showed you was to find out.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how you're going, I actually created this <unk> <unk>
And the truth is that it would be <unk> and it would be <unk>
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this video, and I'm really going to go to the <unk>
This is <unk> <unk> I think I had never seen this before.
I'm going to show you another one of my <unk>
There's a lot more things here, but I don't have time to do it.
This is the very important part of the <unk>
All of you, no matter no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that gives you a <unk>
You can do it in line to create their own museum, create their own collection of all these things.
It's very simple -- I've created this function that I call the power of <unk> -- we just need to make a look around you here.
This is from "The <unk> in the United States.
You can put things out of your friends and keep a conversation about what you are looking at when you look at these <unk> <unk>
So in conclusion, I think for me, the main thing is that all the amazing things really don't come from it.
No, in my view, even come from the <unk>
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
Actually, they come from those <unk>
And that's been my experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital environment, they do justice to their work of art, and it is represented in it.
And the big question that I do today is to give you this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk>
And the answer is no.
This is for <unk> <unk>
And that's it. Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
The first thing you can do is <unk>
I have something that looks like this.
Think that it's a <unk> <unk> <unk>
In our lab, we call a <unk> design <unk>
I'll tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture, I'm going to show you what the children in Italy grow up with this picture on the wall of his head, but the reason I show you this is that it has happened in the last two decades. One in the last two decades.
Now some time, if you wanted to win a career of <unk> one, I took a budget and put it into a very good car, and a good car, a good car, a good car, a good car, and a good car, and a good car, and a good car, and a little <unk>
And if the car and the pilot were just good enough to do it.
So this is what in engineering training, which is a control system in real time.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
Now today, the interesting thing is that research systems in real time are starting to go into our lives.
Our cities, in the last few years, have been covered with networks and <unk>
They're going to go back to the air, and they're coming up.
And as a <unk> they're starting to respond in different ways and they can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is a big thing.
So as I can tell you that cities are only half of the prefrontal cortex, but it takes 50 percent of the world's population, but it takes 50 percent of the world's population <unk>
75 percent of the consumption of <unk> and until 80 percent of carbon emissions from Africa.
If we could do something with cities, it would be a big thing for the cities, it would be a big thing.
More there in cities, all these <unk> and <unk> are going into our <unk> objects in our <unk>
This is from an exhibit of <unk> <unk> for a year at Princeton during the last year.
It's called <unk> by <unk> <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, begin to <unk>
In a certain way that it is as if almost all of the individual atoms are going to be sensors and <unk>
And that's changing all the way that we humans have with the industrial environment and the U.S.
In a sense, it's almost like the old dream of <unk> <unk> <unk>
You know, when <unk> <unk> <unk> it says that at the end I took the ball and put it on the right, so I would still see a little <unk> <unk> and he said, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just a few <unk> <unk> in the idea of taking the environment and make something.
Let's start with the <unk>
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects of our laboratory today.
This was four years ago, and the middle of the South Pole.
It was a summer with sort of a summer with a <unk>
It was the year in which Italy won the World Trade Center for the <unk>
Maybe some of you remember the <unk> and France, and the end of the <unk> gave the <unk>
And anyway, at the end he won the <unk>
Now let's look at what happened that day looking at the activity of the network.
Here is the city.
You can see the <unk> in the middle and the <unk>
This is the morning, before the game is going to play with you.
The time it is in the middle of the <unk>
At the end of the afternoon, there are people here and there are <unk>
It starts the <unk>
<unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
You know, people do a little call and goes to the <unk>
Second <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
First time <unk>
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
They eat <unk> <unk>
And that night they were all going to <unk>
There's the big <unk>
On the next day they were all at the center of the team and the first minister of the U.S.
And then all the world would be <unk>
You see the picture of the place called <unk> <unk> where, since the time <unk> people are going to <unk> it is a great party, you can see the peak of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we wouldn't be able to do it just a few years.
Another example of <unk> is not about people, but of things that we use and focus on.
Today, we know all about the <unk> of our <unk>
This is a map that shows all the chips that make a <unk> and how do you <unk>
But we know very little about where things are going on with things.
So in this project we developed a lot of small vehicles to track the garbage in the system.
We started with a few volunteers that helped us in Seattle a little more than a year, to tag what they were doing, different kinds of things, like you can see, things that are all <unk>
And then we put them a little chip, a <unk> and then we started <unk> <unk>
These are the results of the <unk>
From <unk>
after a week.
With this information we realized there are many <unk> in the system.
We can do the same with a lot less energy.
So these are data that were before we were not enough.
They are going to be the complicated things and there's a lot of natural <unk>
But the other thing that we believe is that if we look at all the days that the cup that we can do is still anywhere in the universe.
And if the bottle of plastic that we put a day still continues on there, it still continues to be there.
So if we take that to people, then we can promote some change from the <unk>
That was the reason that that was the <unk>
My colleague of MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell a lot more about detection and many other things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we talked to the second part we talked about about it.
And the first project is that we did a couple of years ago in <unk>
It all started with a question from the mayor of the city, which came up and said to us, and southern Europe has a beautiful tradition of the use of water in public space.
And the question is, how can technology change technology, the new technology will go to that?
And one of the ideas we developed at MIT, at MIT, in a room -- imagine that you have a <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> which is <unk> and <unk>
It creates as a <unk> of water, with water, and it creates a <unk>
If you look at the <unk> you can write in them, to show you, images, images, <unk>
And at the <unk> the FBI is opening up so that we can go into the image.
We went to the mayor of <unk> <unk>
I mean, I love it.
And I would put a team to design the building to the <unk> of <unk>
We call it <unk> <unk> <unk>
All the building is made of water.
It's not <unk> but when you talk about it, it opens up so that you can do it.
The roof is also full of water.
And if you have a little bit of wind, if you want to make the <unk> you get the <unk> you get the <unk>
Or you can close the building, and all architecture disappears, as in this case.
Those days will always be someone, in the winter, when you get the roof, someone who was there and said, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
No, it's not that they have <unk> but when it comes back almost all the time.
Here is a <unk>
So you see the people who are going to get out of what happens next.
And here I am in the same trying to make sure that the sensors that open your water.
I think I should tell what happened one night when all the sensors left out of work.
That night it was actually more <unk> even more <unk>
All the children of <unk> came to the building because the way to interact had changed a little bit.
It was not a building that was going to be open to you, but a building that I was going to put on and holes in the water, and you had to jump to <unk>
<unk> <unk> And so for us that was very interesting because as architects, engineers, engineers, designers, we often think of the use of the use of the people who will give our <unk>
But then the reality is that it's always <unk>
And that's why the beauty of doing things for us that people use to use <unk>
This is an image of the building with the <unk> and the <unk> of the water, and of them about them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project that I'm going to show you about this.
So imagine that those things were going to begin to make it to make it to make it possible.
Imagine that they could have little <unk> in the air, and that every one had a little <unk> that changes color as if it was a cloud that is moving into space.
This is the video machine.
So imagine a helicopter, as we saw before, which is moving with other people.
We could form this cloud, and we could form this cloud, to form this cloud, to form this cloud, to form this cloud, to form this cloud, to form this cloud, to form this cloud, to form this cloud, to form this cloud, to form this cloud, to form this cloud, to form this cloud, to form this cloud, to form this cloud, to form this cloud, to form this
A kind of flexible screen like this with a normal <unk> in two dimensions.
Or but in three dimensions where what it changes is the light, not the position of <unk> -- not the position of the <unk>
You can play with a different kind of different types of things.
So imagine that the screen is in different scales and different kinds of ways.
And then all of that might a cloud of <unk> which you can do, and you can see from very large <unk>
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like before.
And when the light hits the light, it looks like this.
So imagine every one of them controlled by a person.
We can have every pixel with an entrance that comes from the <unk> of the people, and and so on.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best dancers of <unk> today the star of the <unk> of New York -- and from <unk> to capture their movements in 3D 3D, and using the <unk> for <unk>
Here we can look at <unk>
On the left you see the <unk> in different ways.
This is so complex in real time as it can move into real information.
It can make it all the stuff.
You can go all the way.
And once we have the <unk> we can play with them, with the color and movement, with gravity, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible entrance to the <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project that we're going to go through that we're going to go through the last project.
This is something for the University of London in New York City.
It's called <unk> <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could engage people to make something and change our environment -- like a <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> but with a <unk>
So imagine that we could make a little bit more for a <unk>
And I think the remarkable thing that has happened in the last two years is that, in the last two decades, we spend the physical world in the physical world.
We've got everything, as knowledge, and it's accessible to the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the campaign of Obama -- we can go out of the digital world, the power of the <unk> the physical world.
In our case, this can we wanted to use that to design and make a <unk>
That means something built in a city.
But tomorrow can be to deal with the challenges of mankind, think about climate change or carbon emissions -- how will happen in the digital world.
The idea is that we can do people that people are focused on doing this together, rather <unk>
So the cloud is a cloud, again, made out of the same way that the real cloud is one of the real <unk>
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are <unk>
It's a physical structure in London, but covered in <unk>
You can move through the inside, have different <unk>
You can see from the bottom to be able to share the main moments of the Big Bang, and even more, and it can be used as a form of connection with the community.
So it's a physical cloud of the sky, as something that you can go back as a new top of London in New York City.
You can go there and you can go there and you can go there.
And as it was a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is that being a new experience for anyone who will go to the <unk>
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
I would like to be better than that.
Suppose I told you that, with only some changes in their genes, they could improve the <unk> for a more <unk> and more <unk>
Or maybe I would like to be in better ways, to be more pleasant than having more <unk>
I would like to be more attractive and sure that I would be able to do it.
What would you live more than a good <unk>
Or maybe be of those people who always wanted to be more <unk> to be more creative.
What is the most important thing to do, what is <unk>
What would you do? If you could pick it if you could pick it out.
<unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
How many people <unk>
Raise your hand, let me see.
<unk> would probably have the number of creative people.
That's very good. That's very good.
How many of you know the <unk>
A few more. A few more.
And the state <unk>
A little bit.
What about <unk>
Oh, <unk> -- that makes me feel very well as a doctor as a doctor as a doctor as a child.
If you could have something of this world in the world would be very different.
It's just a <unk>
Or maybe whether it's possible.
Now, evolution has been a subject -- here in the TED Talk, but I want to give you a picture of a doctor on the Internet.
The big <unk> of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> that in the Catholic Catholic Catholic Catholic Catholic Catholic Catholic Catholic Catholic Catholic Catholic Catholic Church -- wrote a trial called <unk>
But if you actually take human evolution, consider this: this is just the past, or the <unk>
It comes to the other or so on.
This is another one of the tree of life.
The human part of this room is not in one end, of course, of course that we will be able to help us.
<unk> from a common contribution to modern chimps about six or eight billion years ago.
In fact, there have been perhaps 20 percent -- 25 species of <unk>
Some have gone and <unk>
We have been here about <unk>
I could look at that we're very far from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, in its vast majority of our cells is more or less the same.
So you realize that we can leverage and control the machinery of a common bacterium to produce the human body that is used to try to make the <unk>
This is not as human behavior, but it is the same protein, which is the same protein, which comes from the <unk>
And talking about bacteria -- you realize that we all have all of the more bacteria that we have in the rest of the <unk>
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, you think about it, when I was a <unk> I asked him what the <unk> think in the <unk>
The other one is a <unk> environment for those <unk>
This is <unk> <unk> is very <unk>
And we're going to provide all the nutrients that you can want to do without effort with your <unk>
It really is a little bit quick for the bacteria with <unk> <unk> of some <unk> to the <unk>
But by doing that, we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential for our life.
They help us digest nutrients and protect us from certain diseases, and we protect ourselves in certain ways.
But what makes us <unk>
We're in a kind of evolutionary equilibrium like this.
Or <unk> to become something different -- something better to communicate the <unk>
In this vast network of the universe, life on Earth is like a little <unk> the animal kingdom, like one and one <unk> and human life and human life -- a little bit of <unk>
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> of this talk so that I hope you have <unk>
When I was just <unk> I had my first class of biology.
I was fascinated by authority, and the beauty of the universe, the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution and I realized something fundamental in most of the existence of life in the organisms -- every single cell -- every single cell -- and all the genetic energy of that cell, is basically the two cells there.
But when you have <unk> organisms start to change things.
<unk> in the <unk>
And a very important thing with the heart rate that happens when the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, you might say that the <unk> of the body death comes in evolution at the same time in the same time.
I have to tell you that when I was a college student thinking, well, <unk> <unk> it was a pretty reasonable moment at that time, but with every year I was more <unk>
And I got to understand the feelings of George <unk> who even <unk> in the middle of his head.
And one night someone hits her door to the <unk>
He opens the eyes.
And in fact, it is a very simple <unk>
And he looks at me, and he says, <unk> in a <unk> of <unk>
And the <unk> says no.
I realized as a doctor, as I was working for a different goal, the goal of <unk> not necessarily <unk> just different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted us to be <unk>
I wanted to get the health of the disease.
I wanted to be more and more <unk> and so on.
The evolution is going to move the genome to the next <unk> and <unk> generation after day.
From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are like <unk> <unk> designed to send the genetic burden on the next level of <unk> and then we will go back to the <unk>
I think that all of them -- the feeling that propelled me by Mr. Allen -- when he said, "I don't want to get my talk through my work.
I mean, <unk> not <unk>
Now, evolution is not necessarily <unk>
They don't necessarily rely on the greater or the stronger or the faster and the faster and the more <unk>
Now, the evolution of the best creatures that are willing to do is to make sure that we can do it.
That is the only proof of survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean, the bacteria <unk> that they can survive the heat of the <unk> which <unk> if they were there -- if they had fish there were <unk> <unk> <unk>
So what it means is, when we look at what's happening in evolution and if we look at the place of humans in the evolution of human evolution, and in particular, if we look at the <unk> I would say there's a lot of things.
The first is that not <unk>
We've seen a species of <unk>
And the universe would be that through medicine, first of all, we've known to preserve vast number of genes that would have been <unk> and <unk> of the population, and <unk>
And secondly, as species, as a species, we have <unk> our environment so that we can change ourselves as we go to it.
And by the way, <unk> <unk> and we will be so sure that it's not possible to have the isolation necessary for the universe.
A second possibility is that you make a human kind of natural sort of natural form of <unk>
And the argument here would be that the <unk> of the evolution of the <unk>
And in the <unk> when you look at the <unk> when you look at the <unk> planets are going to exist and the environmental changes that can produce the <unk>
But there is a third possibility -- a <unk> possibility and interesting.
The <unk> <unk> the new evolution, which is not simply <unk> but <unk> and <unk> for us as individuals in the decisions that we need.
Now, how could it happen there?
How could we get to do this?
First of all, the reality that many people today, in some cultures, are taking decisions about their <unk>
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more condoms than women.
It's not necessarily good for society but it is what you do, but it is what you want.
Think about that if you were to be able to choose not only the sex of your <unk> but in your own body, you would do the exact same thing.
And if we could make the genetic changes, we would be able to reduce HIV, or reduce the risk of cancer or <unk> <unk>
I don't want to make those changes in their <unk>
If we look at the future that kind of changes going to be increasingly possible.
The Middle East Project started in 1960, and I asked 13 years ago.
<unk> <unk> millions of dollars.
At the next year there was the same work in 2004, I could do the same work for 20 million dollars in three months.
Now today, you can get a sequence of three billion base pairs of human genome at a low cost, and in one of a minute.
We don't have a lot to do a lot to make the human genome for <unk> and be increasingly more likely to be more <unk>
They come up with those <unk>
The same technology that has produced human rights can actually make viruses that not only protect themselves from them but they are going to be able to help protect themselves against other people.
<unk> or there's not a experimental trial in course with the flu vaccine, in cells of a <unk> plant in a <unk>
You can imagine a good thing that comes out of the <unk>
This is actually today and in the future is going to be a more complicated problem.
So imagine then that only two little <unk>
You can change the cells of your bodies but if you could change the cells of your <unk>
And if you could change your sperm and <unk> or change the <unk> <unk> and give your children a better chance of a more healthy life than whether or whether they could change their <unk>
Who doesn't want children more <unk> more <unk>
And then, that same technology -- that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent diseases that will allow us to take <unk> <unk> a better life.
Why don't we have the ingenuity of an Ken <unk> about everything if you could go to the next generation of <unk> <unk>
Why don't you have a <unk> <unk> that allows us to run faster and more <unk>
Why don't you live in a different way?
This is going to be <unk>
And when we are in <unk> conditions, this is the next generation and we can take the attributes that we wanted to do the evolution of the <unk>
We're going to take a process that might usually take 100 billion years and we can go back to 1,000 years and maybe happen within the next 100 years.
These are choices that their grandchildren, or the grandchildren of their grandchildren, are going to have to be at the end of them.
We're going to use these choices in the middle of a better society than <unk> more <unk> more <unk>
Or we're going to pick a different attributes that we want for some of us but not for the <unk>
We're going to build a society that is more complicated and more systematic or more <unk> and more <unk> and more <unk>
This is the kind of question we are going to have to do with it.
And the most profound of all, we're going to be able to develop the wisdom and influence the wisdom required to take these decisions to make these decisions.
For good or not, and before what I could do, these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
So imagine a big explosion when you're going to double <unk> <unk>
Imagine a plane full of <unk>
So imagine a engine making <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, I had a car seat that was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only thing I could talk with the <unk> of <unk>
And so I looked at her, and they said, "Well, there's no problem. You probably put some <unk>
The pilot had already got a <unk> and we were not so excited about it.
You could see here, you could see here.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot <unk> the plane with the <unk>
Because that's not the case.
<unk> <unk>
Imagine being in a plane and without <unk>
And then he said three words -- and then he said, <unk>
The three words more <unk> which is <unk>
He said, <unk> for <unk>
I didn't have to talk more with the <unk>
I was able to see it in your eyes, in your eyes, to see it.
It was the life of <unk>
I want to share with you three things that I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a way.
We have this list of things to do before they die, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people who wanted to get and not did it -- all the <unk> that I wanted to find out all the experiences I wanted to have and never <unk>
As I was thinking about that, I came out -- I came out -- I came up with <unk> <unk> <unk>
Because if bread is ready and the person is there, what I'm going to show you to you.
And I don't want to do anything in life.
And that means that the way really has changed my life.
The second thing that I learned that day -- and this is as <unk> the bridge that I didn't have for a lot -- I thought about it, I thought a lot of <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and with my errors I've tried to improve all of what I did.
But in my humanity I also took place to my <unk>
And I want the time to do that in things that we don't know with people who do it.
And I thought in my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with the people.
And also, as a <unk> in that, I decided to take the real energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better but it's much better.
In two years I haven't had a fight with my dad.
It feels like <unk>
And I don't try to have a <unk> <unk> to be <unk>
And the third thing that I learned -- and this is how your mental clock is going to be <unk>
You see the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Why don't you pay for <unk>
I don't want this to be in 20 pieces like you see in those <unk>
And as I <unk> I had the feeling of, you know, they die not too much.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for that entire life.
But it was very innovative.
I didn't want to be <unk> I love my life.
And that means that the <unk> in a single thought that it is, I just want a thing.
I think I could see my children being <unk>
A month later, I was in a place of my daughter -- first grade -- not a lot of artistic talent --   And I would go back as a small <unk>
And for me, that was all the reason to be in the world.
In that point I understand that the two points -- that the only thing in my life is to be a big teacher.
So for all, the only goal that I have in life is to be a good teacher.
And I asked me a couple of questions.
And he asked me another gift that it was the possibility to look at the future and to live in another way.
So you are flying today, the challenge that imagine that the same thing on your plane -- and why don't you know that it's not so -- but I'm going to go back and try to <unk>
What is the thing that we have even wait to do because you think you're going to live in <unk>
How do you change your relationships and the negative energy in the future?
And most importantly, they're being the best parents who are <unk>
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Now, I've been <unk> in life with a lot of <unk>
But the most cool thing in which I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk> <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> of the <unk>
A day came to his house after they run and said, "I feel a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the start of <unk>
Today we <unk> it has a tremendous impact.
You can only use your eyes.
His job in me.
I have a design company and an animation -- so the graffiti is something we call and <unk> in the world in the world.
So we decided that we were going to <unk> <unk> <unk> and to their cause.
So I went and I met her brother and her father and I said, "Let's give you this money.
What are you going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "You know, I want to be able to talk to Tony again, again, again, again, again.
I just want to be able to communicate with him and that he is able to communicate with it.
And I said to him, "This is not that <unk> I can see Stephen <unk> not that all people with palsy, can communicate through these <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you're an important one, and you have a very good one, you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for the <unk>
And I said, "Well, how do you communicate <unk>
Someone to see the movie, "The <unk> and the <unk>
They communicate from that way out of that way.
I said, "That's <unk> How can you be <unk> How can you go?
So I introduced me with my only wish to get a <unk> and instead of that she signed a <unk> I didn't have the least idea of how I was going to <unk>
I met him with his brother and his father there at that exact same time, <unk> -- this is the <unk> Tony is going to try to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to make their art again.
Because it's funny that someone who has so much in their inside cannot be <unk>
So I talked about a couple of months ago.
I met these guys called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> which has a technology that allows you to create a light on any surface and then with a laser <unk> you draw about that and put the physical space into space.
So you go out of there with a piece of art like this.
All the things that we <unk> they say, they're part of a lifetime of life.
First of all, we start with sexual organs and then with the bad words, after the <unk> <unk> and the end, people start to do art.
But there was always a cycle of life in your body.
And so this was so <unk>
And about two years later, about a year after a year after a lot of a lot of move the things from one side to another one of a couple of things.
One, you can put the doors of the drugs, and we have a machine so that we can make a machine like Dr. <unk> <unk> <unk>
What was amazing was amazing.
And seriously, it's about the most <unk> I call <unk> because by talking with the kind of one you get a email from him, and you say, "You know, this guy is <unk>
The other thing that we did was to bring seven programmers around the world -- from all the way to our home.
My wife, the kids and I, we moved into the boat and these hackers and these hackers and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> they took control of the home.
Many of our friends thought we were doing something totally stupid and that when we were <unk> the pieces of the walls and in their place would have <unk>
But for two weeks, we went to the walk of <unk> my son was part of my dog too, and we created this.
It's called <unk> <unk> and you can see the <unk>
They are a couple of balls from the Sun that we buy in the walk of <unk> Beach, California, some of the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
We take a camera camera, and we put it on a <unk> and now there's a device that is free -- and it builds up -- we collect the code -- the software becomes a very low <unk>
And we created a device that doesn't have trouble at all.
There are no medical company who say <unk> <unk> <unk>
There's no hospital that can say <unk> <unk>
Any person with autism today has access to to draw and communicate with only their eyes.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Many of you --   Thank you very much.
So at the end of the two weeks, we went to the room of <unk>
I love this picture because this is the room of another person and that is his room.
There were all this <unk> and <unk> during the great <unk>
And after more than a year of training, two weeks of writing about the entire night, Tony came to draw for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the system of his life and is looking through the family system of his life.
It took the bed, so I could see.
And we put a coin on a wall on a wall of the tree.
And he came to draw for the first time in front of his family and friends, and you can imagine what the feeling in the <unk>
The funny thing was that we had to take in the parking lot, so we would be as if we were <unk> the graffiti as well.
At the end of this, he sent me an email and this was what he said, "This was what he said, "This was the first time he put in seven years.
I felt like I had been under the water, and someone would eventually come back to <unk> and put me up there so that I could <unk>
It's not <unk>
In some form of the form of war.
That is what keeps us in movement, <unk> <unk>
And we have a long way to go with this.
It's a very cool device but it's the equivalent of a <unk>
Someone with this artistic potential is a lot more.
So we are trying to figure out how to fix it, and do it faster and <unk>
Since then we've had all sorts of things.
We've got many <unk>
Remember, it's <unk> none of us are doing money with this.
It takes all of our own minds.
The <unk> were from the <unk> and this is <unk>
Armstrong <unk> something about us and then, in December, the magazine recently recognized that as one of the 50 best artists of 2010, and it was really interesting.
The best thing about all of this -- and this is what the <unk> <unk> is that in January of this year in the <unk> of the <unk> in the middle of Los Angeles will have an exhibit called <unk>
And <unk> in <unk> is going to have the best <unk> of the urban art of <unk> <unk> <unk> all of them are going to be there.
<unk> is going to be in the show which is pretty impressive.
So basically this is my idea: If you look at something that is not possible, we need to change it.
Nothing in this room was possible -- it was possible -- the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> which was possible in a long time.
<unk> <unk> any thing in this room.
I'm not going to have never ever done anything with technology, but I simply learned something and <unk> with wonderful people to do a wonderful thing.
And these are the questions that I want you all to do all the days when we start with something that I think is going to do, if it's not right now, and if I'm not me, you have to do it.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
I've spent the last few years in situations usually very hard and at the same time as <unk>
I went to <unk>
I worked in a <unk>
They were going to be <unk> in <unk> <unk> in <unk>
And I spent 30 days eating a little bit about the beginning, a hard time in the middle, very dangerous to the end.
In fact, in a lot of my career I've been <unk> in situations where the only goal of <unk> with the only goal of <unk> of social issues in the ways that we are going to <unk> <unk> and, eventually, we can see that in a way that you can look at <unk>
So when I knew that they were going to do a little bit about the world in the world, and I wanted to do something a little different.
So some people may have heard, or not, a couple of weeks ago I got a job in <unk>
I brought some messages on Facebook, some of them in Twitter, and they would put the rights of the name of my <unk>
What there was the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- my friend of course, that you don't have a sense of what it is and depending on content in your face, especially if I put it in English, especially if I put it in love with you.
But he said this, it's a very good opportunity to <unk>
You know, how many people look at these <unk>
<unk> <unk>
It's a title of progress, because it's a title of the truth.
So even with that <unk> I knew that someone was going to buy the rights of the name of the name, <unk>
If I had asked him about a year there was not a <unk>
But in the new film that I'm working on, we look at the world of <unk>
And as I said before, I've got to tell you -- I've got to tell you about <unk> in the last few years but nothing would be <unk> for something as hard as it would go into the rooms with these <unk>
Now you see, I had this idea for a book.
<unk> I want to make a film that will be the <unk> of products, and <unk> and <unk> and that all the film is <unk> with <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
The film is going to call the most big film ever since.
What happens in "The <unk> movie, <unk> is that all of the top right next to the end of the end to the end of the day, from the <unk> that shows before the <unk> <unk>
Now this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people are <unk> to the film to <unk>
And so the film shows all this idea, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I am a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> it was more than <unk> <unk> it was more <unk>
It was <unk>
But not only we're going to have the <unk> of the <unk> but we're going to make sure that we are going to make sure all the categories that we can do in the past.
Maybe a shoe and it becomes the largest shoe that you've seen before.
The most cool car that you've been doing in "The New York movie, the best you have heard of <unk> <unk> of "The <unk> movie, <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then to show you the <unk> as part of life, which is what <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and actually demonstrated the whole process of how it works.
The goal of the full film is the <unk>
You're going to see all the process in this film.
That is the idea of all of the things that are going to happen in the beginning of the beginning of it.
And I would love to help you to help make it that way.
Robert <unk> You know, you know, you know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear -- it's the most respect for the <unk>
And yet, I don't know how to get people to it.
You know, you have a <unk> I don't know if you are very <unk> but you know how it goes to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> David <unk> how to do this?
MS: A million and a half and a half billion <unk> John <unk> I think it's going to be hard to go to the meeting with them but not certainly going to be a couple of large ones.
<unk> <unk> -- maybe for the moment that the movie is going to look like a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk>
MS: What you think is going to be the <unk>
Pardon? Most of the answers will be <unk> most of the answers will be <unk>
MS: But it will be hard for the movie, because of the movie, or to be my mother.
JK: Both things.
MS: Yeah, it means that you're not very good enough.
So I really need to be <unk>
MK: Well, I can take it to you.
MS: Okay, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
MK: We have to think about what to do in which of the <unk>
MS: Yes. That is the <unk> When you look at people that you have to do with the people who have to <unk>
MK: We have a lot of places where you go to the <unk> <unk>
MS: I thought that <unk> <unk> meant we have a conversation about <unk>
<unk> the camera means we don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And so it was, one for one of these companies all of all of all these companies in all of all these companies in all of all of all these companies of all of all of all these companies of all of all of all these companies of all of all of all these companies of all of all of all these companies of all of all these companies
No one wanted to have anything to do with this film.
I was a <unk>
They didn't want to know nothing with this project.
And it was very <unk> I thought that the concept of advertising, was that the product would be as much as possible, because so many people saw it as it was possible.
Especially in the world today this intersection of new media and old media, and the stage of the physical media, is not the idea that the new car car is going to take the message to the <unk>
No, that was what I would say.
But the problem was, you know, that my idea had a <unk> and that mistake was it.
It's actually not, there were no such thing as possible.
There was no mistake at all.
It would have been good.
But the problem was what it represents this image.
See, when you look at images of <unk> on Google <unk>    this is one of the first images that we have.
I like your way to <unk> <unk> <unk>
This was the problem: The <unk> of simulation of a simulation or <unk> easily <unk> or <unk> easily <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for the <unk> or access of information on all of the practices of <unk> being the last line maybe the last line maybe the last line is probably the last line maybe the last line maybe the last line is probably the last line maybe the last
You see, we hear a lot about transparency in these days.
Our political <unk> the president of the <unk> even the <unk> even <unk>
But suddenly when it comes to this is what it looks like.
But why? Well, the transparency day --  like that <unk> <unk> that still continues to <unk>
It's <unk>                       Thank you very much.
And it's also very interesting.
What one other thing is <unk>
And then a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
That's very interesting.
So when I started talking with companies and I would tell you that we wanted to tell this story and said, "No, we want to be <unk>
We want to take a story, but that <unk> <unk>
See, when I was a child and my father in some lie -- and there he is here -- as he used to <unk> he said, <unk> there are three sides in every story.
It's your history, it's my history, and it's the story of <unk>
As you see, in this movie, we wanted to tell the real story the real story.
But with only a company, a company, an organization -- and that just because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> from many -- I realized that I would have to go for my self, I would have to take out and go to the <unk> and go to companies with all my team, and go to the <unk>
So what I started from suddenly -- and I started to give you a little bit more than when you start with the idea of understanding your view of understanding your <unk>
MS: I have friends who make friends who make large films and others who do small films like mine.
And my friends who make films of large Hollywood movies say that the reason their films have so much success is that they have so much success as they do.
And then my friends who make independent films say, "Well, how are you going to compete with these big giants films from <unk>
And the film is called "The most <unk> movie <unk>
How are we going to look at <unk> in the <unk>
Every time I'm going to go back every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk>
At any time during an interview with someone with someone I can say very cool for this <unk>
You're going to look at you a little bit. You're <unk> You're <unk>
I want to tell you that you <unk>
Maybe you would be a little bit of this before the <unk>
And there would be one of these <unk> <unk>
In <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> are going to have their opportunity.
We're going to have as a man as a man as a man as a <unk> <unk>
That is the <unk>
Now I can answer your questions and give you a little bit <unk>
<unk> <unk> we're a small <unk>
And I would put the type of films more small than <unk> we are more <unk>
That's why we don't have the budget that they have other <unk>
So do things like that, you know, you know, you know, let's remind people to be the reason that this allows us to fix it.
MS: What words would you want to describe to <unk> <unk>
<unk> is in <unk>
So this is a great question.
Roger <unk>
MS: Now play -- not the way you want to describe something that you can put in the <unk>
Man: We talk about something <unk>
I think that <unk> is a great word that actually puts this category in positive versus <unk> the smell and <unk>
It keeps going.
So how do you take a little bit more <unk> with better <unk> with more <unk> three times more <unk>
Things like those who have <unk> the <unk>
MS: And that's a company called <unk>
What do you do about me? What does this mean of a <unk>
I need to talk to the man in the street, to people like me, to the <unk>
They have to go back from my home.
MS: How do you define your <unk>
Louis <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I like the clothes that I like to love you.
Woman: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> unless it is a <unk>
MS: Okay, what is <unk>
And I would say <unk> <unk> <unk> I guess the kind of wisdom that I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I would like a lot of different colors and things like this.
That's why I'm going to take you as <unk> or <unk> or the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk>
Woman: If Dan was a <unk> I could be a <unk> <unk>
Man 3: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
So in part <unk> in part of the <unk> in part of the <unk>
Man 3: I am the kind of <unk>
<unk> toys in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my wish.
In my small budget, that is my wish.
Man 2: My <unk> is <unk> because I <unk> the <unk>
Man 3: <unk> <unk>
That's it. That's it.
<unk> I'm a <unk>
<unk> I'm a <unk>
MS: Well, we can't all be <unk> but often I'm going to do it in the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized that I needed a <unk>
I needed someone who could go in my head, someone who could help me understand what I call the <unk> of <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in <unk>
They helped companies come to companies like <unk> <unk> to discover that familiar, of course.
If they were able to do it for them, they would probably do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the pictures, right?
MS: Yeah, the first picture is a <unk> picture of a <unk> photo that's a <unk>
You know, a little bit about how it works with your thoughts and feelings of being your way of being in your way.
MS: These <unk> people in the world. My world will see the world.
And I was going to talk about that world.
MS: So I believe that your world is the world in which people who are going around -- your friends, the way you live your life, the work that you do, the work that you do in your life, the work that you can do your work to you.
All those things are <unk> and they start in a place and in my case, and they start in my family, and they start in school.
So what is the next thing that you want to do here?
MS: The next one is "This was the best day of my story.
So how does this change this with your thoughts, feelings and your way of <unk>
MS: This is like who would want to be my <unk>
I just like the different things that I do.
I like the things I would like to do, I just like the <unk> things <unk>
The <unk> of the <unk> for what it takes to us is that?
What's the <unk> What is the <unk> What is the <unk>
So why is it important to <unk> What is the <unk>
So a little bit about that.
<unk> <unk> more than you, which is not who you are.
What other <unk> You've got <unk> you've got <unk>
It doesn't have to be a <unk> What kind of mountain <unk>
MS: <unk> <unk> <unk> No, thank you.
So because of your <unk> <unk> A lot of <unk> <unk> <unk>
MS: Yeah, I don't know what you're going to go back from this. MS: Yes, I don't know what's going to go back from this.
There were a lot of shame at all this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing I saw was this idea that there are two different sides of the <unk> but <unk> in your personality, <unk> <unk> <unk> is a <unk> <unk>
They were very <unk> very well.
And I think there is almost a paradox at the top of it.
And I think some companies will only be <unk> in one of their strong points or in the other instead of focus on it.
Many companies tend -- and it's the nature of taking the things that are not going to be <unk> and the fear, those elements -- and you can actually go back and make a positive thing for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other are <unk>
The first here is the <unk>
And you can see here to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are <unk> and <unk> and <unk> those things that have gone and put it on it, but a <unk> is something quite different.
MS: A <unk> <unk> What's your <unk> What's your <unk>
If someone asked you, your identity identity is your tongue <unk> what would you do?
You're a <unk> You're a <unk> You're somebody who makes the <unk>
Or you're more likely to be more <unk>
A little more <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The attributes of <unk> are like being a sort of cool thing like <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- like <unk> <unk> <unk>
Or you're more likely to <unk> <unk>
You're sophisticated representations like this.
You're going to be familiar with <unk> <unk> you know, <unk> <unk>
You're a lot of familiar sexual familiar, except <unk> <unk> or <unk> -- like the Dalai Lama or <unk>
In the course of this movie, we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> that they said -- they didn't want to form a part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this movie, primarily because they don't have control, they don't have control, they don't have control on the <unk>
It allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we have to tell the story in this movie, how now they use the open resonance to identify the <unk> centers in the brain so that to be able to get to the <unk>
We went to San Francisco, where they have accepted education in the air.
In the middle of the city over the last five years, there are no <unk> there are no <unk> there are no <unk>
And we went to districts where companies are reacting to the schools in schools with problems in the United States.
The amazing thing for me is that the projects that I've had the biggest answer or what I've been more successful are those in the ones that I've been doing with things.
And that is what they did these <unk>
They were going to <unk> they took the <unk> and they said perhaps these agencies don't have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to try to get directly to the <unk>
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that is going to do to the people, which is going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how do you have a <unk>
Well, since the movie, the movie, the <unk> of <unk> take a <unk>
According to the <unk> the movie, the movie, and since then, of course -- and this is not a <unk> we've had 1.5 billion media programs for this <unk>
This is just a period of two weeks and a few weeks ago.
That's just in <unk> not in <unk> not in <unk>
The movie is still <unk>
It's not in it, it's not in <unk> It's not in <unk>
They don't even have in other countries.
Ultimately, this film has already started to win <unk> <unk>
And it's not bad because almost all of the agencies who talk about the ones that we talk about <unk>
I have always believed that if you get older, if you take risks, if you take care of those risks there are <unk>
I think when you get to the people of that is in the <unk>
I think when you ask your employees at the risk of <unk> it is doing all their company for <unk> <unk>
I feel that what you have to happen to do is that we have to encourage people to <unk>
We have to encourage people who don't have fear of the opportunities that they can <unk>
In the last often, I think we have to give place to the <unk>
We have to put that bear in a <unk> and we have to put it in a <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
So in a <unk> at the time, we have to ask the question, how do we deal with the <unk>
And in the end, we have to get to the <unk>
Today, more than a little bit of honesty is going to go a long way.
And he said this, and we transparency, all my talk <unk> <unk> has been brought by my good friends of the great friends of the <unk> who have the rights of the name in <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data in large opportunities for companies around the world.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Many people.
June Cohen: So, <unk> on behalf of transparency, which happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: This is a great question to do.
In my pocket I have a <unk> name on the TED organization, the <unk> Foundation -- a <unk> for <unk> to be applied to my own career for the TED period.
The idea behind the <unk> computer is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to take the car to <unk>
His biggest active investment to develop nuclear weapons is the <unk> plant, in <unk> in <unk>
The yellow boxes that you see are <unk> systems in real time.
If we were able to engage these systems that control and <unk> we can cause a lot of problems with <unk> <unk>
The yellow boxes are not using software software that are in a completely different way.
But if we were able to put an effective virus in a portable computer used by a engineer to develop this complicated box, then we are <unk>
This is the plan behind <unk>
We started with a <unk>
The <unk> of the <unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> nuclear program is <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's easy, <unk>
I want to tell you how we discovered this.
So when we started looking at <unk> about six months ago, the purpose was completely different.
The only thing that I knew is that it's very, very complex in the part of <unk> <unk>
It seemed like to do something with these little <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
So that's what it called the attention, and we started an experiment where we were doing our environment with <unk> and we saw what happened with this.
So it was very interesting.
<unk> <unk> as a rat in a laboratory to which I didn't like our <unk> but I didn't want to be a <unk>
I had no sense to me.
And then to experience with different mathematicians, I realized that, and I thought, this is a <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's completely <unk>
The <unk> is looking forward in the red box if you find a <unk> and even if the program that is trying to do this is actually working in this particular direction.
And if no, you don't do anything.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because we <unk> we don't know what the <unk>
It could be, say for example, an energy plant or a chemical plant, or a chemical plant in the brain.
What we would <unk> the goal was to go back to it.
So we put it and put the code of it, and we found that I was <unk> in two <unk> <unk> a little bit of a little <unk>
We also saw that they were armed and they were very poor, so we had no all the time.
So we all know all the points that you can do with it.
You probably know how much <unk> the <unk>
So you know what?
And if you've heard that the <unk> of <unk> is complex and high-tech technology, let me tell you the <unk> is very important.
It's very above all that we've seen before.
Here you see a sample of this <unk>
We're talking about about 15 thousand lines of <unk>
It seems like the old language, the old language <unk>
I want to tell you how we were able to understand this <unk>
What we do is they were called the functions of the system, because we know what they do.
And then we <unk> and <unk> and <unk> structures and we tried to do it with the real world with potential goals of the real world.
We need theories about them that we can have or <unk> or <unk>
In order to get to theories about goals, we remember that it's definitely a <unk> <unk> should be a white white <unk> and it's probably the majority of the <unk> because it's where most blood vessels have been <unk>
They don't find several thousands of goals in that area.
Basically it turns out to be the plant plant plant, and to the plant of <unk> of <unk>
So I said to my <unk> <unk> a list of all of the experts in <unk> and plants use the energy between our <unk>
And I called them and I asked them to get them into a effort to build their experience with what we found on code and data for it.
And it worked quite well.
So we were able to put the little <unk> with the control of the <unk>
This is that part of the <unk> in the <unk> that black person.
If you take the speed of this <unk> you can certainly <unk> and even make the <unk>
So what we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow and <unk> in a obvious effort to go back to the engineers of <unk> so that they couldn't solve this stuff.
So we tried to figure out the digital <unk> looking at the data and their <unk>
So for example, the number of <unk> is in that code, you can't <unk>
I started looking at a scientific literature about how these <unk> are built in <unk> and found that they're <unk> which is called <unk> and each <unk> contains <unk> <unk>
That was sense, there was a <unk>
And it got better <unk>
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called <unk>
And guess what we find in the code of <unk>
One structure is almost <unk>
So again, that was a good example.
So this gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had in our hands.
So for that not only <unk> it wasn't enough.
The results have been to be a number of several weeks ago.
<unk> <unk> in <unk> and we had to go back to the <unk>
And yet, we found that both digital <unk> to one and the same thing and the same thing.
The small <unk> is taking a shutter and making the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
In <unk> we are very <unk> in that we've determined what the <unk> <unk>
It's <unk> and it's just <unk> and it's just <unk>
We don't have to worry about the other goals are <unk> by <unk>
So here I show you a few very interesting things that we have to do with me.
There's the green box and you see the <unk>
So what this thing does is to kill the values of light of sensors for example, of blood pressure and the sensors that are going on and provides <unk> code -- which is still under the <unk>
And believe it or not, these data points are <unk> by <unk>
This is as in Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the video camera camera on video games.
It's great <unk>
So the idea here is not only <unk> to the <unk> in the middle of your head.
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is that a digital security system is <unk>
We need public security systems where a human brain cannot be able to do it.
So for example, in a energy plant, when the large carbon dioxide is going to move to speed, you need to open <unk> <unk> in a <unk>
Now, this cannot be a human being.
This is where we need public security systems.
And when you're <unk> then you can go to <unk>
The plant can <unk>
And not the <unk> nor the security system is <unk>
That <unk>
But it can be better.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk> <unk>
It doesn't have anything to see, especially with <unk> with <unk>
It could work also, for example, in a energy plant, or in a factory in a <unk>
It's <unk>
And you don't have to be <unk> that we combine this <unk> with a key key as we saw in the case of <unk>
We also could use the conventional technology to be <unk> for <unk>
And so we need to do it.
And if you look at that, with what you <unk> it is with a <unk> <unk> <unk>
That is the consequence that we should be <unk>
Unfortunately, the biggest number of goals for such disease is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and in Japan.
All the green areas are spaces with huge number of <unk>
We have to face the rules and best we start to get back now.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has been the public in many sides that people say that <unk> is the main entity behind this.
What's your <unk>
So you can actually do it. You really want to hear this?
Yes.
My guess is that the <unk> is involved but the engine is <unk> but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the engine behind this is the engine behind this one.
There's a room -- and that's the United States, luckily, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Because, in other words, our problems would be even richer than the other way.
CA: Thanks for <unk> Thank you.
I want you to imagine a robot that can take and get them to <unk> or another one that would make sure that users of chairs would raise and go back to <unk>
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk> <unk>
It's not anything that you put in the morning, which gives you a great force that also increases your speed, and help them help them to make the <unk>
It actually is the real way of the man and the <unk>
But not only that -- it can integrate and connect with the universe and with other things.
This is not a <unk> idea.
So to show you now what we're working now on what we're working started by talking about the American soldier who, in average, has to take on his back a <unk> <unk> and it's <unk>
Now, this leads to some of the important factors -- one of the most important drivers in the back of the soldiers -- with <unk> <unk>
So we decided to look at this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help to make the <unk>
Let me introduce you to the <unk> -- or <unk> <unk>
So with the exoskeleton to <unk> <unk> I can take them down, and they will take them for many months.
His design -- it allows us to put themselves in <unk> <unk> and make predictions with great <unk>
And I want to do what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then the strength and my <unk>
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this new <unk> this year, this year, this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
Let me show you how you look at the audio users, which I feel particularly interesting.
There are <unk> millions of people who are born in chairs with <unk> in the world.
As one percent of the population, we have a <unk>
And this is a really interesting thing.
We talk about something that happens with unfortunately very young people in the column that will start their life -- to the 20, 30 or 40 years -- <unk> on a wall and a chair -- it turns out to be your only one.
We also talk about the population, which is going to be a little bit.
His only option, many times -- by a brain disease, or some other <unk> -- is the chair of <unk>
And this has been so during the last 500 years since its successful <unk> like I have to do it.
So we decided to start to write a new chapter of a new story.
So let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using <unk> <unk> who does eight years ago in the <unk> and as a result was not going to go back to eight years ago.
<unk> Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
EB: Number is using our <unk> that <unk> <unk>
It has a lot of sensors on it.
It completely didn't be <unk> in the details, that they send signals to the computer, here in the <unk>
There are also a few batteries that give power to the engines in the <unk> and on the feet, and it makes it look at this little <unk> and it makes it <unk>
It was 24 years ago in the top of my life when, by a strange <unk> in the air, and it costs me <unk>
In a fraction of the second, I lost all the feeling and everything that was going to be possible.
And so far, a doctor walked into my room in the hospital, and he said, <unk> I never come to <unk>
So that happened next week.
And so I told me until the last few months of hope of my life.
The technology technology has been allowed to be allowed to be able to learn <unk> it costs a little bit away in <unk> <unk> and even building a little <unk>
But they haven't invented anything that allowed me to walk, until now.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
EB: So as you can see, we have technology, we have the platforms to sit and talk about this.
This is in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change life to future generations -- not only about cars, but to <unk> and all of the tests of <unk> to everyone.
Thank you. Thank you.
I just came back from a community that has the secret of survival human survival.
This is a place where women have <unk> struggle to say, <unk> and play is the order of the day, where the video is a little bit like this.
And no, it's not the festival whatsoever, or San Francisco.
And ladies and gentlemen, you know, they have to do it.
This is the world of the <unk> <unk> of <unk>
The bonobos are, along with the chimpanzees, their dreams and the most <unk> lives.
That means that we all share a common cause, a grandmother who lived about six billion years ago.
Now, chimps are known by their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've done too much in this aspect of the human nature.
But the cop tells us the other side of the building.
Whereas the chimps are dominated by very large types of big, <unk> society is in charge of <unk>
These guys have created something special because this leads to a society where violence violence still hasn't been <unk> where the violence hasn't been <unk>
But unfortunately, the bonobos are the least <unk> of the big <unk>
They live in the middle of the forest -- and it's been very difficult to <unk>
The Congo is a <unk> which is an extraordinary land and beauty, but also the heart of the <unk> <unk> of a foreign conflict that has been evolving for decades and caused almost so many deaths like the Second World War.
It's not surprisingly, that this destruction has also put in danger the survival of it.
The blood vessels of hunting and coal, they do it that you can't fill out a stadium with the bonobos that get in the world, and we are not sure about it.
However, in this land of violence and <unk> you can hear the exact opposite.
Who are these <unk>
Now, we know like <unk> <unk> love -- not the <unk> because they have sex <unk> and <unk> and <unk> to support conflicts and solve social problems.
I'm not saying this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the life of Bangladesh is more than the <unk> <unk>
The <unk> like the humans, I love to play a lot of his life.
It's not just a game of kids.
So for us and for them -- and for them that game is critical to establish the <unk>
With it to <unk> and we learn the rules of how to play with them and make the rules of it.
The game is that creativity and empathy, and you have to see with the generation of <unk> diversity of sexual interactions, diversity of human beings.
And when you look at the game game, you see the exact same roots of laughter, and the dance and <unk>
The game is what the game is going to happen.
I don't know how to play you -- but I want to show you a couple of pictures just about the <unk>
First, it's a game called <unk> and I don't talk about it.
Here we have a female and a young male and a young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look at what's doing it.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the 20th century, and it has <unk> <unk>
I just think that in this case, he says to me, right?
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.
So the sexual game is common as much as in <unk> as in human life.
And this video really is interesting because it <unk> this video is really interesting because it shows the invention of bringing elements to the game as the <unk> and also how the game requires and <unk> and <unk> and the same time is more fun.
But the game is <unk>
The game is <unk> you can take a lot of ways -- some of which are more <unk> <unk> -- maybe the place where you <unk>
And I want to show you this is a <unk> a young young young girl, who is playing with water <unk>
I think as it was, sometimes we were going to take them, and we explore the limits of our inner worlds and 60 percent.
And it is that kind of <unk> which comes to explore, and then the unexpected connections that we are going to be the real <unk> the real <unk>
These are just small samples of the understanding of understanding of our past and trying to understand our past and work.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future where we have to adapt to a world more difficult to greater creativity and greater <unk>
The secret is that the game is the key to these <unk>
In other words, the game is our <unk>
In order for success to a world that we have to play, we need to play it.
But <unk> at the bottom of the <unk>
The game is not <unk>
The game is <unk>
So for them, and humans and humans are not only <unk> and <unk>
So when you look at the same way -- you can be the times that it is the most enjoyable one.
And so I would argue that this gift of evolution and <unk> together as <unk> creativity, the friendship and the <unk>
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
In New York -- I'm responsible for development of an organization called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
When I'm not battling poverty, <unk> <unk> as I was born in a body of <unk>
And in our city, where volunteers <unk> a highly highly specialized staff, you have to get to the site of the name of the <unk>
I remember my first <unk>
I was the second <unk> at the site, so I had a very high probability of it.
But even so there was a career in front of the other volunteers to get the captain to charge and figure out what it was our own.
And when I met the <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with the <unk> that no doubt about the worst days of his life.
We were in front night, she was standing outside in <unk> under a <unk> in <unk> <unk> while his house was in <unk>
The other guy who just had before me, <unk> <unk> <unk>  came back up until the captain and this was asked me to go back and put him up on the dog at home.
The <unk> I was <unk>
There was a lawyer or a member of the money that, during the rest of his life, I would have to tell people the people who walked into a building in a living building, just because he won the <unk>
Well, I was the next one.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need to go between the home.
I need to be <unk> <unk> <unk> and I went to this woman a couple of <unk> <unk>
What do you do?
It wasn't exactly what I expected but <unk> I got the stairs, at the end of the park, I went to the <unk> <unk> which would go back to that height or less and less than one of the top of a couple of weeks ago.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a scientist.
I took my head out of the staircase where I met my <unk> and the dog on the door of the <unk>
We take the house on the house at the <unk> of the house where, as it was about six, your <unk> had a lot more attention than the me.
A few weeks later, the department received a letter from the Royal School of <unk> by the important effort to save his home.
So the thing that she looked at on the other was that someone had reached a couple of weeks ago.
Both in my <unk> in <unk> <unk> as in my <unk> as I do, I am witness of <unk> and <unk> in a <unk> scale, but also of <unk> and courage and courage to <unk>
And you know what I've done.
It takes all the time.
So when I look at this room to people who have <unk> or you're going to get a great success of success -- I don't know.
They don't wait to win the first million <unk> to make the difference in life in your life.
If you have something to do, you can get something to <unk>
<unk> food in a <unk> <unk> a <unk> park in <unk>
I will be <unk>
Not all of the days we're going to have the opportunity to save life from someone but every day we're going to be able to influence the life of it.
So they get to the <unk>
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Yes. Yes.
Mark <unk> Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
This may seem strange -- but I'm a big fan of <unk>
The first blocks of the concrete blocks were built in <unk> with a very simple sense of <unk> <unk> <unk> of a <unk> <unk>
Very quickly, these became the most used unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build the most big things that we, as buildings or <unk> a <unk>
Essentially, these blocks have become the <unk> of our time.
About a hundred years later, in 1975, to <unk> the <unk> came up with this.
It was called <unk>
And in a few years, the <unk> of <unk> came to all of the <unk>
It's estimated that there are more than 400 billion dollars, or 75 percent of every person on the planet.
We don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful, buildings or whatever.
<unk> did it <unk>
And so I simply gave the computer block, the favorite piece in the world, and it became a critical piece of our lives.
Meanwhile, the same time in the labs -- the next revolution was about a new revolution -- the new piece of <unk>
The transistor was a little bit of plastic that took us from a world of <unk> <unk> to a world where all of it was <unk>
By the end of the time, the transistor allows us to create much more complex circuits and more complex <unk> a <unk>
But there is a difference to <unk> the transistor was only for you.
I think we don't know what the building blocks of our time are, so I decided to go back to the <unk> so I decided to <unk>
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab I started exploring the idea of bringing the power of engineers to the hands of artists and <unk>
A few years ago, I started to develop <unk>
I'm going to show you how it works.
<unk> are intelligent <unk> each one with a lot of <unk>
They are <unk> to be light, sound, engines and whatever.
And the best thing about it is that they go through <unk>
So you can't put it in a small way.
The <unk> they have a code of light.
The green is the <unk> the blue is the stream, and the yellow is the entrance and the red line is the <unk>
So you only have to put a blue blue with a green and very quickly you can start to make natural gas.
A blue here with a green <unk>
We can put a button in the middle and we have a <unk>
So if we change the button by a <unk> which is here, and now we have a <unk> light <unk>
And so this is to create more impact and we have a machine of <unk>
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are actually very important.
Instead of going to be able to connect and <unk> <unk> it allows us to program using very simple <unk>
To do it faster or more easily, it simply makes this button that makes the pulse be faster or more likely to be able to do this <unk>
The idea behind <unk> is that it's a collection of <unk>
So we want all of the interactions in the world to get to the <unk> to make it happen.
It would be a lot of sound solar panels that will be <unk>
We've got to <unk> the kids to see them with them.
And it's been an amazing experience.
The best thing is how you start to understand the electronics of all the days that we don't learn in schools.
For example, how it works is a light of night, or why the door of an airplane is destroyed or how an iPod responds to the <unk>
And also we've also taken <unk> schools to school schools in New York.
So for example, designers have no experience in electronics start to play with <unk> like a <unk>
Here you can see, with <unk> and <unk> we have to <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk>  A few weeks ago, we took a few weeks ago, and we took the designers from the <unk> design to look at this experience in engineering, only in engineering and paper and paper, and said, "What would you say?
So here is an example of a project that has actually been a <unk> <unk>
But you see, here comes my <unk> project, but here's my wish.
This is a <unk> <unk> which is a <unk> that has fear of <unk>
So for these not engineers, <unk> became another material, the electronics turned into another <unk>
And we want this material to keep it to the end.
That's why <unk> it has to be <unk>
You can visit the website, you can see all of the design files and <unk>
So we want to encourage a world of popular and collaborators because this world in which we live, this world is our own.
So forward and <unk>
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Today, I'm going to talk about the amazing thing.
I work in the global technology industry in the solar system.
And my small company is going to do with the building in the developing world.
Thank you.
This is a little video of what we do. This is a little video of what we do.
It would be a long time.
You can take a little in <unk>
We can continue to continue the video to one side to one side to one side.
No. No. No. No. No. No.
This is not -- this is it.
Very good.
The solar technology is -- the solar system.
Oh, you know, I'm going to show you a couple of things.
All right. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
A couple of years ago I started an initiative to recruit the best designers and research for them to take a year and work in a environment that represents almost everything that is supposed to work in the government.
The initiative called <unk> for <unk> and would be like a few <unk> <unk> for <unk>
And so many members of the year and we put them to work with the <unk>
Instead of going to the Second World War, we put it into the <unk> world <unk>
They were very big <unk> they worked with the <unk>
His job is to show the possibilities of technology and the real <unk>
<unk> <unk>
When it comes to the city of Boston, I was a <unk>
Here it shows you as if you would get a look at it, but what you really look for is that someone would take it out of water, because you know that it's not very good for <unk> when it is covered by a square of a <unk>
How do you get help from this way so <unk>
Last year in Boston in Boston, we had a team of <unk> for <unk>
They were there in February and at that time, <unk> a lot of the year before.
They realized that the city had never seen these <unk>
But one of the members called Erik <unk> I noticed something more than the citizens of <unk> the <unk> just in front of them.
So he did as long as I had a good career.
It's a nice app where you can take a <unk> <unk>
You <unk> <unk> when you <unk>
When you do that, you put a name, in this case, put <unk> <unk>
If you don't do it, someone can do it.
I mean, you have a <unk> component <unk>
This is a <unk>
Maybe the most small of the 21 applications -- the year before.
But it makes something that no one of the other technology technology is <unk>
And it becomes a <unk>
A lot of <unk> systems in the middle of <unk> to see this app realized that I could use it not for the snow, but for the citizens of <unk>
This is very important to work with these <unk> of tsunami, but people get their <unk>
And so I asked the citizens of the <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make the citizens <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And Chicago just came out of it to make people <unk> to clean <unk> when they were <unk> when they <unk>
So now we know about nine cities that we call <unk>
And this has been <unk> in a very complex way and natural sense.
If you know a little bit of social technology, you know that this doesn't happen to me.
The software software program is actually a couple of years ago.
Last year in Boston -- we had a team working on a project that was about three people for two months and a half years.
It was a tool for parents to pick the best public school for their kids.
And then we told us that we had done by the normal channels there would be taken at least two years and five million dollars.
And that's not true.
Now there's a project in the power of California that up to the moment of the time it has five billion dollars, and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this in every level of government.
So an app that came up in a couple of days, and it was <unk> in the way it was a <unk> <unk> to the government.
It allows us to be the best part of work, not as in medical companies as a lot of people think that it should be.
It's not as a technological company, but more well as the own Internet.
I mean, without <unk> in form open and <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that represents the way we deal with the government that has the new <unk> not as a problem of an institution -- but as a problem of collective action information.
And that's very good because it turns out that we're very good for collective action with new technology with new technology with new technology.
And there is a very big community of people who are building the tools so that we can get together with <unk>
And it's not only <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people in all the country that provide for applications -- all the days in their own bodies.
They haven't been given for the government.
They want a great frustration to be a great frustration to be <unk>
And this people know something that we've lost in the air.
And it is that if we stop the feelings of politics, the line in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all those other things that we put up the government is, essentially, in words in the words of Tim <unk> What we do together because they don't <unk>
Now, a lot of people have crossed the government.
If you're one of those people, I would ask you to do it, because things are changing because things are changing.
The politics of the politics are not <unk>
And because the government at the last time that we have <unk> -- remember that of the <unk> the <unk> the way we think about making change.
I didn't know much of the government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought that the government would be able to pay people for <unk>
Well, after two years I've come to the conclusion that the government is, about everything, just about <unk>
This is the center of the health care center and information.
This is the place that he calls that if you go to the United States in America.
Scott <unk> this <unk>
He said, <unk> at the basis of <unk>
I didn't know anything, it started with control of the animal kingdom.
And he finally said, "Hey, you can open the doors of the house, put music, put music out and see if you <unk>
And so we knew that it was just by <unk>
But that wasn't the end of the <unk>
And here is not a center of <unk>
It has a website and mobile phone called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I don't know that <unk>
It was the work of very smart people from the Office of New York.
One day, this happened in this <unk> <unk> in my cube -- I don't know if it is <unk>
How do I do to <unk>
The dynamics of <unk> <unk> is different.
Scott was talking in person. Scott was talking in person.
In <unk> <unk> all of this is public -- so everybody can see this.
In this case, he saw a <unk>
On the next report he said, "I'm going to go back to the place, I found the garbage cube behind the home.
<unk> Yes.
I was home, I went home.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
This is interesting. This is the confluence of the digital and physical math and physical design.
And it's also a big example of the income of the government to <unk>
But it's also a big example of the government like this.
And here I don't necessarily mean the technological definition of <unk>
I'm talking about a platform for people to be <unk> and help each other.
So a citizen helped another but here the government had a big role to <unk>
I went to the two people.
And I might have connected with local services to the government services of being necessary but your neighbor is a better alternative than the <unk>
When an aid neighbor helps us to be able to get them to the <unk>
If we call control of animals, that costs a lot of money.
One important thing that we have to think about the government is that it's not the same thing.
A lot of people do it, but you think that one is the entrance to the other.
That our entrance to the government of government is <unk>
How long have you chosen to be chosen for a <unk> or sometimes we spend a lot of energy to pick a new cultural leader, and then hope that the government <unk> our values, our values, but then we don't see it.
That is because the government is like a huge ocean and politics is the equivalent of 15 percent.
below this is what we call <unk> <unk>
And we say that word for a long time.
But it is that <unk> which keeps us doing that that we propose as something that works in our own, that one thing, and in which we're missing the power.
People believe that politics is <unk>
If we want this institution to have to do that in order to make it <unk>
Because it's there where the real work of government.
We have to collaborate with the logic of government.
That makes the <unk> <unk>
They have <unk>
This is a group of citizens who have written a very strong report report called <unk> pages in response to the <unk> of <unk> <unk> about the <unk>
That is not the politics of the political <unk>
And so for those we have <unk> the government, it's time that we ask ourselves what we want to stop our kids.
So you have to see the huge challenges that they have to do with it.
We really believe that we have to go to where we have to go without solving the institution that can act in the name of <unk>
We can't wait for government, we need to pay for government, we need to be more <unk>
The good news is that with technology is possible to be able to rethink the quality of government, so that it can expand to society.
There's a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not so hard to act <unk> we only have to engage the systems in the right direction.
The average age of our members is about 60 years ago, so I myself, I am a greater generation than many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up to taking the word and giving it a little bit more for me.
They're not giving that battle that we all faced that battle that we all face about who are going to kill them every day.
They can express their opinions at any rate and they do it.
So when you get the problem of government, you don't matter to do it.
They're using their hands.
And so there hands up to the work to program applications that make the government.
And those applications allow us to use your hands to improve our communities.
It might be a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a garbage cube that has a <unk> on the ground.
Since then, we were always able to have <unk> those <unk> and many people do it.
But these applications are like <unk> digital <unk> which is not only about the government we pay taxes and we get them <unk>
We are more than that, we are citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until we don't get the <unk>
So I want to ask you all the details, when it comes to the important things that we have to do together, we all have a team of voices, or we will be a crowd of <unk>
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
This is for me a real success.
I've spent the biggest part of the time in <unk> prisons and in the U.S.
I've spent the biggest part of my life in communities in projects and places where there are a lot of <unk>
And being here at TED looking at this, looking at them and texting me a lot of energy.
One of the things that I've noticed in this short time is that TED has <unk>
And the things that they say here are the impact on the world.
Now, anyway, if something comes from TED, it has a sense and a force that I don't have to be a other way.
I say this because I think the identity is <unk>
So here we've seen <unk> <unk>
And I think we have learned that the words of a teacher can have a lot of sense, but if they work with it, they can have a meaning to happen.
A doctor can do good things -- <unk> if it's <unk> it can make a lot more.
And so I want to talk about the power of <unk>
And I really don't know this in the practice of the right and my work.
I learned from my <unk>
I grew up in a traditional family of a family family, which was a <unk> which was my <unk>
It was <unk> it was <unk> it was <unk>
It was the last word in the family.
She <unk> many of the <unk> in our home.
It was <unk> of people who had been <unk>
His parents were born in slavery in 2004.
She was born about <unk> and his experience with slavery -- the way he saw the world.
She was <unk> but it was a <unk> but it was a <unk>
And when I was a little and a little boy, she came to me and gave me a good idea.
I was so strong that I could barely touch it, and then I would go back to me.
One or two hours later, I went to <unk> and said, <unk> I still feel my <unk> I still feel my <unk>
And if I said no, I would go back to my new and if I was telling me that I would give you a <unk>
I had this human quality that I would always want to be about to be about it.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was the lower of the <unk>
At the time, when I was going to spend a time with it, it wasn't easy to take her time and her attention.
My cousins were running for all of us.
I remember when I was eight -- nine years ago, I woke up one morning, I went to the room and there were all my <unk>
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and I looked at <unk>
At the beginning I thought it was a piece of paper.
So I looked at him and said, but she was very upset.
And after 15 or 20 minutes, she came up in the room, and he said, <unk> <unk> The two are going to be a <unk>
I remember this as if it was <unk>
I'll never forget it.
It took me back and said, <unk> I will tell you something, but you can't say to the <unk>
I said, "You know, <unk> <unk>
She said, "Oh, <unk> <unk> I said, <unk> I said, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And then I sat down, I looked at me and said, "I want you to know that I've been <unk>
And <unk> <unk> who are <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you want.
I'll never forget it.
And then he said, "You know, I want to leave you three things, <unk> three things, <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And he said, "The first thing I want you to do, is that you always want to get your <unk>
And <unk> <unk> is my <unk> and you have to <unk> that I always <unk>
As I <unk> my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> so <unk>
And then he said, "The second thing I want to do, is that I will always get the right right now, even though the right thing.
I thought and I said, "Yes, <unk>
And then eventually he said, "The third thing I want to do, is that I would never be <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
I grew up in the field in the South Bronx, I have a brother and a lawyer and a sister for a year ago.
When I was 14 -- I was a day my brother came home with a package of six <unk> I don't know where the <unk> gave us my sister and to me, and we went to the <unk>
And so we just got to do the <unk>
He took a copy of <unk> he gave my sister, she gave me a little and asked me a little bit and asked me.
I said, "No, no, no. It's fine. It's good. But I'm not going to take <unk>
My brother said, <unk> today -- and you always do the same thing that we do.
I already took something, your sister as a <unk>
I said, "Oh my God, I don't feel good. You can <unk>
And then my brother I looked at me and I looked at me.
And he said, "What do you say?
And I got to look at the <unk> and I would say, "Oh, you don't be thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you doing?"
He says, <unk> tell them all the grandchildren who are <unk> they are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something about you.
I'm going to tell you something that you probably can't say to say no.
I know that this is <unk>
But I have 52 years and I can admit that I've never ever taken a drop of it.
I don't say this is that it's a <unk> I say the power that you have the <unk>
So when we create the right type of identity, we say things other that they really don't look like a sense of information.
We can't get to do things that they don't do to do it.
I think my grandmother believed that all their grandchildren were called <unk>
My grandfather had been in <unk> during the <unk>
My grandmother died of diseases born with <unk>
And these were the things that, according to that, we would have <unk> <unk>
Now, I will try to talk about our social justice system.
This country is now very different from what it was about 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 2,000 <unk>
Today, there are <unk> <unk>
In the United States, we have the highest rate of the world.
We have seven million people in freedom of <unk>
And this <unk> in my view, has changed all our world.
In rural communities or <unk> it is so much <unk> so it determined by these things.
One of every three black holes between 18 and 30 years is in prison or at the <unk>
In the United States of all over the country, New York City, New York City, New York City, New York -- all the young people are in prison or in freedom
Our system is not only <unk> in front of race, it also is about poverty, poverty, etc.
In this country, we have a legal system that is much better if you're rich and honest that if you're poor and <unk>
It's not <unk> but wealth which means the results of the results of the outcomes of the outcomes of the outcomes of the outcomes of the other.
And it seems to us, we feel very <unk>
The politics of fear and <unk> we do to believe that these are not problems that are not <unk>
We're <unk>
I would look interesting.
We're looking at our work some of our work in our work with very <unk>
In my state, in Alabama, -- as in other states, you know, you would be aware of rights because you have a <unk>
Now at the same time, the <unk> of the black population has lost the right to listen to the <unk>
And if we apply the next 10 years the loss of rights will be as high as it was before it was before it was before it was before it was <unk>
We have this amazing thing.
I'm going to go to school.
Many of my customers are very <unk>
United States is the only country in the world where I was asked for children to die in jail.
We have in this country prison for children, without any chance to go back to the <unk>
Now we are in a process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
They were going to get people in the <unk>
This thing about death penalty is interesting.
In a sense, they have <unk> to think that the final question is, people deserve to die by <unk> <unk> <unk>
A very good question is very important.
But you can think of another way about how we are in our minds.
There's another way of <unk> it's not to decide whether people deserve to die by civil war, but if we have a <unk>
This is interesting. This is interesting.
The death of death in the United States is defined by <unk>
In every nine <unk> people have found one that is ill that it is <unk> and <unk> of the death of death.
One rate of <unk> <unk> an innocent <unk>
This is interesting. This is interesting.
In <unk> I would not be able to read if every nine to each nine to <unk> you would have <unk> you would have <unk>
But in some way we would get to the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our <unk>
It's not our <unk>
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue of if you have a <unk>
It's interesting that in my classes with students about <unk> <unk> I'm talking about the <unk> I'm talking about the <unk>
I'll talk about the <unk> the time I started at the end of the rebuilding and that brought up to the Second World War.
We don't know much about this.
But for American Americans in this country, it was a very important time for me.
In many communities people were afraid to be <unk>
I was worried about being <unk>
The threat of terror was what makes their lives.
Now there are more people who come up and tell me to tell me to tell me to tell me --    <unk> <unk> <unk> people who let them say that in our history of the first time with <unk> after the <unk>
And I asked me to tell you that I was like, <unk> <unk>
The era of terrorism was basically with <unk> and decades of <unk> <unk> and <unk>
In this country, we have a dynamic that we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our history.
And this is why we haven't understood the meaning of what we haven't done before.
All of the time you get a lot of other things.
We should have tensions and conflict.
It costs us to talk about <unk> I think it's because we are not willing to engage with a very specific process and <unk>
In South Africa, people decided that they couldn't overcome <unk> <unk> without a commitment to the truth and the <unk>
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this opportunity, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany giving reports about the death of death.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers came out after my presentation and said, "You know that it's okay to listen to what you <unk>
<unk> <unk> We don't have death rates in the <unk>
We can never be able to do it.
The room was going to silence and a lady said, "You don't have a way that with our history, we can never go into the <unk>
It would be easier to do, and we would be able to get rid of it.
<unk> about this.
How would we ask ourselves in a world where a nation as Germany, <unk> people, especially if they were in their <unk>
We didn't do it.
it would be <unk>
And yet, there is this <unk>
I think our identity is in <unk>
If we actually don't care about these issues so much, the positive things and wonderful things are, yet <unk> <unk>
We love innovation, we love it.
So how does the technology.
So we love it.
But the question is, these realities are <unk> by suffering, the <unk> the <unk> the <unk>
In my view, it's necessary to integrate these two things.
We talk about the need to have more hope, greater compromise, more engagement with the basic challenges of the life of this complex world.
I think that means to spend more time thinking and talking about the poor, the <unk> the <unk> who never will be at TED.
So if you think about them it is, in some sense, something that is within our be.
It's true that we have to believe in issues that we haven't seen before.
So we were so excited so successful with the intellectual property with the intellectual <unk>
This is innovation, with creativity is not only about the ideas of life.
These things come from <unk> <unk> also because of the <unk> <unk>
So this connection to the mind with the heart is what drives us not only in bright and <unk> but also in the dark and the <unk>
<unk> <unk> the great <unk> <unk> talked about this.
He said, "When we were in Europe, and we were in Eastern Europe, suffering -- we wanted all kinds of things, but mainly what we needed was how we needed to know what we needed to do it before.
Well, that part of the spirit is pretty much in the heart of what I think in communities like TED, because <unk> <unk>
There is no disconnect between technology and design, that allows us to be truly human, if we don't pay attention to poverty, to protect poverty, to change poverty, to be <unk>
Now I want to say that these thoughts make a much more complicated identity than if we are doing these things.
I would be <unk>
I had the great fortune to be a very young lawyer to meet <unk> <unk>
These women were so sure to do it.
Occasionally, the lady <unk> me to me, <unk> <unk> comes the lady <unk> We are going to join them to speak to you.
You want to come and <unk>
And I said, "Well, I know that I would be <unk>
And so she said, "Well, what do you do when you go to <unk> when you <unk>
I would say <unk> <unk>
So I was like, and I was simply <unk>
It was very <unk> very <unk> very <unk>
And in one occasion, I was sitting there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple of hours, Mr. <unk> came to me and said, "I know that it is that idea of justice and <unk>
So what you're trying to do is to make sure that you are <unk>
And I started to give my <unk>
I said, "Well, we're trying to ask the <unk>
So we're trying to help those who have been <unk> <unk>
We were trying to deal with <unk> and freedom in the Bush administration of the <unk>
We tried to end up with the sentences of life, without freedom of <unk>
We tried to do something about it.
We're trying to reduce the population in the <unk>
We tried to end up with the <unk>
I took all my best voices, and I would end up and said, "You know, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In that moment, Mr. <unk> put me into the face and said, "It's so that you have to be very <unk> but very <unk>
I think in reality, the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We have to find the way to address those problems, that <unk> <unk> <unk>
Because eventually humanity depends on compassion as much as possible.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been <unk> in the <unk>
I've come to understand that every one of us is top of the worst thing we have <unk>
I think that's true for all the world on the planet.
I am convinced that if someone says a <unk> it's not because it's a <unk>
I'm sure if someone takes something that doesn't exist, it's not that it's a <unk>
So if someone falls to another, it's not that it's a <unk>
And so I think there's a basic dignity in the people who have to be <unk> by <unk>
I also believe that in many parts of this country and, certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite to poverty is not <unk>
So it's not.
I really think that in many parts of the poverty is the <unk>
And finally, I think that although it's very beautiful, very beautiful, very beautiful, very <unk> is not simply simply giving us our technology, because our actions are not by our collective capacity or another.
At the end of the end of a society, the character of a society, not by the way they treat poor poor and <unk> but because of how they treat the poor, the <unk>
Because it's in this context as we started to understand how we started to understand about what we were doing.
Sometimes I feel <unk> I'm going to end with a story.
I sometimes do so much more.
<unk> <unk> like everybody else.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> of a very important.
I've been researching these kids who have been <unk> with a lot of <unk>
I'm going to jail and I see my clients and I see my clients and 14 years old, which have been <unk> so that they were <unk>
And I begin to think, how can it be?
How can you be a judge to convert someone in what it's not going to be?
The judge would be <unk> as an adult, but I see a little girl, but I see a little girl, but I see a little girl, but I see a little girl, but I see a little girl, but I see a little girl, but I see a little girl, but I see a little girl, but I see a little girl, but I see a little girl, but I
One night I was getting <unk> for God, if the judge can convert it into something that doesn't exist, because they have to be <unk>
Yes, <unk> the judge has to be <unk>
I would say something about it.
And as it was very short, I couldn't think right, but I started working on a <unk>
And I had a client for 14 years ago.
I started working on the <unk> with a <unk> who said, <unk> for my hometown of 14 years -- whether a white white <unk> of a <unk> of a <unk>
In <unk> I came out with <unk> <unk> in the <unk> in the behavior of the police behavior, and in the process.
There was a <unk> of how it was in this country -- but the whole lack of consciousness.
And the next morning I woke up thinking that <unk> would be a dream, or actually the <unk>
By my age, I didn't only have the <unk> but he had sent the <unk>
It was about two months ago, I had been there before.
And eventually <unk> <unk> <unk> I have to go to the <unk> for this case, right?
And I got to the car and I felt very <unk>
I was in the car or it was in <unk>
I thought that this would be very difficult and <unk>
I eventually went out of the car, and I went back to the <unk>
I went down the door, when I found out with a black man <unk> it was the <unk>
And when I came up with him and said, "What is it?"
I said, "I am a <unk> He says, "It's a <unk> He said he did.
And so I asked him, and I would say, <unk>
And I would say, in the morning.
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
So that's very deeply with my face, with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a <unk>
Well, I went to the <unk>
By the way, the judge saw me he saw me.
And he said, "Mr. <unk> you wrote this <unk>
I said, "I'm <unk> Mr. <unk> and we started <unk>
People started <unk> They were all <unk>
I was what I had written those <unk>
They asked them the <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And suddenly, without knowing how, the room was full of people, and we were all going out because we were talking about poverty, because we were talking about poverty, because we were talking about it.
With the <unk> of the eye of the eye, I got to see the <unk> I was and <unk>
I look at the window and you hear all that <unk>
And I would go back to here and for there.
And finally, this old black black, with <unk> walked in the room and sat behind me, almost at the table of the <unk>
About 10 minutes later, the judge <unk> a <unk>
During the dawn of the <unk> a <unk> was called <unk> because the <unk> had run in the room.
The <unk> <unk> on the old black <unk>
And he said, <unk> what you do in the room of <unk>
And the old black <unk> I looked at the <unk> I looked at me and said, "You know, I went to this room of <unk> to tell this young woman who would get her sight to <unk>
I've been here to TED because I think that many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very big, but it turns out to be <unk>
That we can't be truly human beings, if we don't care for human rights, and by the way.
That our survival is connected to the other side.
That our views of technology, entertainment and creativity should be <unk> to the <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And above all, those of you who share this, I simply want to tell you that we have the view of the goal with <unk>
Thank you. Thank you.
Chris Anderson: <unk> of course, and looking at the audience of the audience of this community, to help do something like this.
So something that is not a <unk> What can we do? What can we do?
<unk> There are several opportunities to get the <unk>
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> this spring in which it's going to be an effort to <unk> the funds that have spent today in politics of it.
For example, here in California, you are going to spend a billion dollars in death row in the next five years, a billion dollars a month.
And despite this, the <unk> of <unk> not <unk> in <unk>
The <unk> of <unk> don't go to it.
Here's a chance of change.
So this <unk> is going to propose that it is going to be <unk> these funds are the law, and that's the law of life.
I think there's a very good idea.
CA: There's been a huge decrease in the <unk> in the United States, in the last three decades.
And part of the reason it says that you have to see with the highest rate of <unk>
What would you say to the people who believe it is it?
And indeed, the rate of <unk> with violence has been relatively quickly.
The big growth in <unk> in this country is not by civil society.
This is by the <unk> war against the <unk>
This is why it comes to this increase in the United States.
And we let us convince ourselves for the <unk> of <unk>
So we have three legal causes to take people to supply people to rob a little bit away with a little <unk> for the property, instead of doing that <unk> those resources to their own.
I think we need to do more to help the victims of the <unk> and not even more <unk>
I would seem to be that our current philosophy of fear doesn't do anything for you.
I think that is the strength that has to change.
CA: You know, you've been excited to be excited about this.
You're very <unk>
Many of them have come to TED. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
And so we found out the threats for breast cancer.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Several years of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Oh, thank you.
Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips that I got in the last six months, <unk> might be the last six days or over the last six years.
So the idea is that the media media would prefer to make sure that our minds would pay attention.
And that responds to a very good thing.
In every second of every day our senses will get a lot more data than the brain can be <unk>
And as anything else, the first line of all of those data is an old bit of an old piece of paper called <unk>
The Sun is our <unk> <unk> at the end of the day.
<unk> and <unk> all the information in looking at something in the environment that I could actually make a <unk>
And so from a <unk> of a <unk> of <unk>
That old saying of <unk> "If there are blood, <unk> is very interesting.
And given that all of the digital devices gave us a positive news about seven days of a week, 24 hours a day, 24 hours a day, not just that we are <unk>
It wasn't surprising that people think that the world is going to happen.
But maybe it's not like this.
Maybe instead of change, what it really happens is we have <unk> <unk>
Maybe the huge progress done in the last century by a series of forces is <unk> so we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good <unk> climate change the extinction of species and <unk> <unk> not just the <unk>
As human beings are very good for <unk> the problems and, in the very first we end with them.
And so what happened in the last century to see where we started.
In the last hundred years, the average of life has been more than <unk> income per capita per capita per capita has been <unk> across the world.
The child mortality has been about 10 times.
In addition to the cost of food, the cost of food and communications, and communications, it costs 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> We showed us that we are living the most successful time of the story.
And Charles said that the world's population, spent about 80 percent of 80 percent in the last 50 years.
We are actually living a very long time.
A lot of people do it.
And we continue to <unk> more <unk> and we continue to <unk> <unk>
In fact, we really understand the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in the United States, much of the people who live under the poverty line have electricity, water, water, water, air, air, air, air, air, water.
The <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the 20th century, the <unk> of the planet, would never have been, with such <unk>
<unk> a lot of this is technology and, you know, its growth, and then it gets <unk>
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that we put in technology in this curve, the Moore's Law Act, and it's the performance of the price in a few months.
So the mobile phone that you have in your pocket is a million times more cheap and a thousand times faster than a couple of years ago.
Now look at this <unk>
This is Moore's Law during the last hundred years.
I want you to look at two things in this room.
First, the little thing that is -- at good and bad work, in the war and in peace, in depression in depression in <unk>
This is the <unk> computers that were used to build <unk> computers to build a more traffic <unk>
It doesn't appear to be the best of the great <unk>
And even though it's <unk> in a law to the left is going to go to the top of the <unk>
The rate of technology is in itself, every single time we have more <unk>
And in this curve, it comes to <unk> on the left, there is a series of incredibly powerful technologies that we have today.
The computing in the cloud, that my friends call computing processing sensors and networks, 3D printing and their ability to reconstruct and <unk> production on all the planet, artificial biology -- the vaccines and food, the vaccines and the <unk>
I mean, how many of you saw the victory on <unk> of <unk>
It was <unk>
I looked at the neighbors the best thing that I would <unk>
And so I loved it, <unk> <unk> <unk>
You see, it's not a bad thing.
He said, "You know, with the <unk> of the human nature.
So imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available for all of them in the field.
Four years ago, here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new college called <unk> <unk>
We taught these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can we be used to solve the big challenges of life?
And every year we asked them to get a company, or a product or a product or service that can affect the lives of billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students today can impact the lives of a billion people.
Thirty years ago, that would be <unk>
We can point out a <unk> of companies that have already done before.
So when I think in order to create <unk> it doesn't mean to create a <unk> life for each other, it is to create a life of what possible.
This is about taking that is to take that and make it <unk>
You see, the <unk> is <unk> and technology is a force that protects <unk>
I'll give you an example.
This is a story of <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk>
He is the kind of <unk>
And I asked him to go to school.
The troops ate the troops they ate with <unk> and the same <unk> and the same thing.
But the king of <unk> ate with <unk>
You see, the rain was the most valuable metal metal in the middle, it was more than the black and <unk>
And so the tip of the <unk> to Washington is about <unk>
You see, even though <unk> is the <unk> of the mass of the Earth's Earth, it doesn't come as <unk>
It's taken by oxygen and <unk>
But then it came to the <unk> and it made a huge amount as cheap as if it was <unk>
And I would say this analogy to the future.
Think about it as much as possible.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are on a planet by 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They go to the Earth 16 times of <unk>
It's not about <unk> but it's not about <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar energy in India is 50 percent less than the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>
The cost of solar energy went 50 percent last year before.
Last month, MIT published a study that shows that at the end of the decade, in the parts of the United States, the electricity costs cost six cents a hour -- compared to the 15 cents of <unk>
And if we have abundance of energy we also have to open water.
I'm talking now about the wars in the water.
Remember when Carl Sagan came out of the dark space towards the Earth, in 1990, after the United States.
<unk> a picture of <unk> How do you <unk>
<unk>
Because we live on a planet of water.
We live in a planet covered in a planet covered in <unk>
Yes, the <unk> is water, the <unk> is ice, and <unk> by the <unk> of the sea of the planet, but it's also a <unk>
It's a technology available not about 10 or 20 years old, but now it is.
It comes to the <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen, this morning, one of the innovators of innovators -- I would like to share with you with a technology called <unk> and the technology called <unk> which is the size of a small <unk>
This is able to generate a thousand square miles of water in the day of any <unk> <unk> water, a <unk> for less than two cents a day.
The president of <unk> just from <unk> that will make an important test of hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that's right, and I have much confidence in which I would be able to implement it in <unk> countries from the planet.
This is an extraordinary innovation for this technology that has been a technology that has been <unk>
And we've seen in the <unk>
God is going to go to 70 percent of the mobile phones in the late developing developing developing world.
And I would say, <unk> have better communications communications in the middle of Kenya that the president <unk> <unk>
And to say with a smart mobile phone with Google, it has access to more knowledge and information that the president of 15 years.
It lives in a world of information and communications that nobody might have predicted before.
What that, the things that you do, and I have paid them tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- video versions of books and music, technology -- now <unk> and lose value on the ground with the <unk>
Maybe the best way to get the applications in health.
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce with the <unk> Foundation -- something called the Nobel Prize for 10 million dollars.
We're going to make the teams of the world to make these technologies in a mobile device with which you want, and because you have <unk> you can see blood pressure can be <unk>
To win it has to do better than a medical team in the <unk>
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors, where the <unk> <unk> is 25 percent, and there are <unk> of the health.
So when this device <unk> a <unk> virus or DNA that we don't have to call the health, and at first to avoid the <unk>
But this is the biggest force of producing a world of <unk>
And I call the billion <unk>
The white lines here are the <unk>
We have been the <unk> of the seven billion dollars.
By the way, the best protection against the nuclear explosion is based on education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, <unk> <unk>
By 2020, we're going to go from two billion people to five billion dollars.
Three billion people have never been before <unk> that it comes to the global conversation of global thinking.
What would you want to do these <unk>
What do you <unk> What do you do? What do you do?
And instead of a economic collapse we will have the biggest <unk> of the story.
These people are tens of thousands of dollars of dollars to the global economy in the global economy.
And <unk> of more health, because of the <unk> of a better education with the Stanford Academy and because of the use, in 3D use and computing in the cloud will be more productive than never before.
What can we give us 3,000 million more than the most of the world's biggest <unk>
What a lot of voices never before <unk>
What if we give them <unk> wherever they are, a voice to be heard, and be able to act for the first <unk>
What do you <unk> these 3,000 <unk>
And if they are <unk> we can't <unk>
One thing that I learned with the Nobel Prize is that teams of a lot of their passion with their passion with a goal, of course, they can make things <unk> things that were only the big corporations and <unk>
I'm going to end with sharing a story that I really <unk>
There's a program that maybe some of you have already seen.
It's called <unk> <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington, D.C.
This is a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids, and to figure out the way that you get to the <unk>
The <unk> the structure and the <unk>
It's a very important thing in medical research in medical research in medical research.
And until now, it was a problem of <unk>
They were played with this teachers in the middle of each other.
And then hundreds of thousands of people sat down and started <unk>
And it has demonstrated that today the machinery of human patterns is better than the best computers that the best computers might ever have.
Ladies and gentlemen, what makes me a huge confidence in the future is that we have more power as people to take the big challenges of the planet.
We have the tools with this new technology.
We have the passion of the <unk> <unk>
We have the capital of <unk>
And we have 3,000 billion human minds that are going to work in the solution of big challenges and make what we should do.
We have for a few decades ago.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very simple idea.
The <unk> of the <unk>
And as the idea may be in a minute, before I'll give you three examples to do time.
The first story is about Charles <unk> one of my favorites.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
And perhaps they thought they were going to be <unk> but it wasn't like this.
It's actually <unk>
And he described one of them as a very <unk>
It was the <unk>
And he asked him much for the <unk>
Now the fish is in the <unk>
But we've heard this story a lot of times, about <unk> and other places, so that it doesn't have anything to happen.
But the case is that we still go to the <unk>
We even think they're <unk>
The <unk> still say they're going to be <unk>
So what does it look like?
The second story that we also call the <unk> of <unk>
Because I was there in <unk> studying a forest in Africa called <unk> <unk>
I was there because I grew up in Europe and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought it could be <unk>
I used a lot of the sun and I was convinced that I was not from there.
This is my first exhibition at the <unk>
This was surrounded by <unk> and, as you can see, of a few months.
There were <unk> of about 20 <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And the forest of this <unk> was very stable and spent for a long time, so it was more than half of the United States.
When I went there 27 years after the number of fish had gone down to the <unk>
I would go to the five <unk>
<unk> an electrical pressure <unk>
There were no <unk>
In a sense, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing to happen, but everything has changed it -- but everything has happened.
My third story is that I went <unk> at the introduction of <unk> in Europe, and I found out the <unk>
In the <unk> we started in the <unk> Europe conducted a lot of different projects in the developing world.
Local development would be <unk> in the countries that they had already 100 <unk> <unk> the fishing fishery was <unk>
And this little boat was called <unk>
I went to fish in him, and we found studies in the south of the United States, and about everything, in the United States, in the United States.
So what we did was we started something <unk>
And so now I know, the bottom of the sea is now <unk>
And 90 percent of what we captured were <unk> other animals that are in the <unk>
And most of the fish are <unk> <unk> about a few <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk>
In short, the bottom of the sea came up and then it was <unk>
So these images are extraordinary because the transition is very close to a very simple question.
In a year, you do a study and then we start the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The bottom line of being a strong coral rate in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a <unk>
It's not the <unk> <unk> because they were <unk>
And once we take a look.
I still wasn't <unk>
So they wanted to <unk> because it was a good food.
So this is what the <unk> the fishermen every time you go to an area where you've never seen it.
But there are no <unk>
And the world -- but we don't do it.
And the point is to go back to the new level, without remembering what was there.
If you look at this happens something like this.
On the Y-axis, we have <unk> <unk> <unk> number of <unk> <unk> of the country, the blood supply of water.
And that changes with time changes, because people do things with <unk>
Every generation can use the images to the beginning of their conscious life as the normal thing and <unk> it to see it.
The difference is that the loss of loss is the loss of loss of loss of loss of loss of loss of energy.
But not the loss that happened before.
You can look at the <unk>
And at the end of the end to keep a <unk>
And that, in a great extent, it is what we want to do now.
We want to keep them to keep things that they don't are, or they're not what they do.
But you should think that this problem affects people when traditional societies have given animals not to know what they have done until a few years.
Because, obviously, an animal that is very sensitive before that is very important.
You don't lose animals, <unk> <unk>
You lose a little bit of <unk>
Even if this doesn't matter like a big <unk>
With the time, we focus on the big animals, and in a sea sea surface.
They become <unk> because the <unk> <unk>
With time we have a few fish but we think that this is the point of view.
And the question is, why do we do this?
Well, because we don't know that it was different.
In fact, a lot of people, scientists, <unk> that it was very different.
And it would be because the evidence was delivered in a very earlier way, not the way they would expect that they would be <unk>
For example, the <unk> that some <unk> as he said to me, and I looked at a lot of fish in this area can't be used or, usually the scientists were being used -- because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we live in societies, but they don't rely on the sources of the Internet.
And in there the huge role that can make an area of <unk>
Because with the dark areas we really need to be <unk> the past, the past, the past.
<unk> the last thing that people can't do, because the point of <unk> has been in and is extremely important.
That's for the people that you can see an area zone and you can benefit from the vision of the vision that it allows you to compute its point of view.
And what happens with people who can't do it because they don't have access, as people of the Middle East, by example.
I think there are the arts and theater maybe you can fill it up.
This is a simulation of the <unk> <unk>
It was a lot of time there were whales in San Francisco, about 500 years ago.
And you'll have noticed that the <unk> and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about it, if you think about what people would be in the movie, I would talk about the story of <unk> why <unk> with <unk>
Because it does something that in a sense, it has been ready for a sense, it has been <unk>
And so my <unk> the only thing that I would do, is to ask them to do <unk>
Thank you. Thank you.
Hello. I am Kevin <unk> who <unk> <unk> <unk> and I look at YouTube videos in the <unk> form of friends.
It's true. It's true.
So today we're going to see why the videos are doing <unk> and what makes it it.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> When I was younger, that was a very, very difficult thing.
But today the video here makes any of us, or of our actions, you put it in a part of our global culture of our global society.
Anyone can do a famous Internet on the Internet in a <unk>
They go over to YouTube to YouTube for granted.
And, of course, only a small percentage of a small percentage is <unk> it gets a lot of <unk> and <unk>
How do we do that?
Three things from the <unk> communities, and the key to the key to the <unk>
Well, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh, thank you.  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
God <unk>
+ a minute.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this video out of his house in San Francisco, of course.
In 2010, it was seen 23 million times.
This graph shows the <unk> at the end of the summer last year.
<unk> not just to make a video <unk>
I just wanted to share an arch of <unk>
That's what you do if it's called <unk> <unk>
There were published a lot of videos of nature.
This video was published in <unk>
And so what happened here?
It was <unk> <unk>
I <unk> I had this wish, that <unk> the video to the <unk>
So the creators of trends like Jimmy <unk> put us up and interesting things and interesting things and interesting things to a greater <unk>
And <unk>                                                   It's <unk>    You all want to be the end of a week, the end of
<unk> <unk> <unk> is one of the most popular videos of the year.
So you saw almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the frequency of <unk>
At the end of the day, I would propose this video -- this video seems to be a <unk>
So, what happened this <unk>
Well, it was true.
And if you ask for those other <unk> they're also <unk>
But what happened this day, this Friday day, this Friday day in <unk>
Well, he took <unk> and many blogs started to write about it.
Michael <unk> From <unk> Science Research -- it was one of the first people in doing a joke about the video on Twitter on Twitter on Twitter on Twitter on Twitter on Twitter on Twitter on Twitter on Twitter on Twitter on Twitter on Twitter on Twitter on Twitter on Twitter on Twitter on Twitter on Twitter on Twitter on Twitter on Twitter on Twitter on Twitter on Twitter on
But the important thing is that a person or a <unk> group of trends -- a point of view, and they share with a very deep public public space.
So this community of people who have this big joke -- then starts to talk about that and do things.
And now there are 10 <unk> of <unk> on YouTube.
So only in the first seven days, there was a parody for each of the other days.
Unlike the collective entertainment of the 20th century, this is our way of being part of the Higgs phenomenon, or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an animation -- with a <unk> music with a <unk>
That's what it is, that's it.
This year you saw about 50 million times.
And if you think that that is difficult, you know that there's a version of three hours that has seen four billion times.
Until the girls saw this image.
And there are arguments that you saw in other words, looking at the video video here.
But the important thing here is the creativity that I woke up between the <unk> community of the Internet.
There were <unk>
Someone did a version of the <unk>
And then it became a <unk>
Suddenly, the whole community was that he made this thing to be a brilliant joke about what we all can do, and we all can form it.
Because today not only <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Who might have predicted something like this.
Who might have predicted that there might be anything else, <unk> <unk> or <unk> Black or <unk>
What does it mean to have written that <unk> this <unk>
In a world where you get two days of video for minute, just the only thing and unexpected can <unk> the way these things have been done before.
When a friend told me that I had to see this big video of a guy who fought against the <unk> in New York City, which I didn't talk about it.
<unk> <unk> I would be <unk> by the <unk> but often there are obstacles that keep you out on the <unk> of the <unk>
KA: Because because of the effect of the effect and your humor, <unk> <unk> I managed to get five billion and a half of it.
So this approach is not for all the new ways that we do a very good way to do it.
And all this leads us to a great <unk>
<unk> <unk> What does this?
<unk> <unk>
KA: What does it mean for this?
Now, the creators of the creative communities of participation, the totally <unk> are characteristics of a new type of media, which we all have access and is the audience that defines the <unk>
And as I said before, one of the most important <unk> of the world, <unk> <unk> started on YouTube.
They didn't get permission to express their ideas.
Now we all are a little owners of our <unk> <unk>
These are not the characteristics of the old media, not the characteristics of the media, but <unk> the entertainment of the future.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
This is not a story.
It's a puzzle that is still <unk>
So let me tell you about some of the <unk>
So imagine the first <unk> a man in the entire life.
It's a poet, a <unk> a man whose entire life had been supported by the only unit in the hope and freedom of his country.
<unk> as the <unk> come into <unk> <unk> the fact that his life had been totally in <unk>
The words, for so much time -- -- now what <unk> <unk>
It was <unk> in <unk>
<unk> for the story.
He's my dad.
I'll never forget it.
But our lives are much more than our <unk>
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My task was not to let it be in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story I tried to <unk> but it was <unk>
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat at dawn <unk>
My mother, <unk> was so only 18 years ago when his father died, and a marriage marriage and two girls were <unk>
By the age of it, life had gone to a <unk> job, and it was not a new life in South Africa.
It was <unk> for them that I couldn't get it.
And then of a <unk> of four years that the fiction, a boat is moving towards the sea floor.
All the adults knew the <unk>
The biggest fear were the <unk> the <unk> and death.
As most of the adults, my mother came up with a <unk>
If we were <unk> first we had my sister and I, and then she was and my <unk>
My first memories are about that boat -- the total rate of the motor, the <unk> <unk> on each other, and the vast cost and <unk>
I don't remember the ones that came out of several times, but they were <unk> with the courage of men in our boat, or the engine of the <unk> or the engine -- and not going to <unk>
But I remember the lights from the platform in front of the coast of Mexico, and the young man who grew up and died, I would end up the journey it was too late.  And the first apple that would be given by the men of the <unk>
No arm had the same thing.
And then after three months in a field of <unk> <unk> in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women over three generations giving a new life together.
We put them in <unk> a couple of weeks ago -- whose population is <unk>
Unlike the suburbs of the middle class whose existence -- in <unk> there was no sense of the <unk>
The <unk> of <unk> were the rest of the world.
And the <unk> of English -- the people who had a thing in common: were starting from a lot, were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then in a line of cars, working six days, three days, twice as well.
And yet, I found time to study English and get a title on behalf of the <unk>
we were poor.
All the dollars were <unk> and it would be a little bit extra in English, and mathematics, no matter what it should be <unk> which is usually <unk> <unk> was always <unk>
Two <unk> pairs for school, you get the holes in the other.
A school school in the <unk> because I had to last six years.
And there were brown <unk> and <unk> about <unk> <unk> and some <unk> and some <unk> go back to it.
He gave her home.
One thing in me is <unk>
I was sure and a voice that I said, "I'm going to be <unk>
My mother, my sister and I <unk> in the same way.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we would go back to our day and put the movements of our grandmother in the home.
My mother had <unk> all of the time.
And my task was to be <unk> until his <unk> <unk> to be able to get <unk>
She opened a computer shop and then I studied to be <unk> and opened another country.
And women would come with their stories about men who couldn't do the <unk> <unk> and they would be able to do something between two <unk>
It was a <unk> and <unk>
And they were created by them.
I lived in the worlds of <unk>
In one, it was the graduate student with what I would do with what I'm going to talk about.
In the other, I was <unk> in the lives of <unk> <unk> <unk> by the violence, the loss of drugs and <unk>
But many of them were helping help us through the future.
And because of that job, when I was studying my last year of a <unk> I would put the young woman in the year.
And I was <unk> from a piece of the puzzle to the other, but their edges didn't go <unk>
In <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> was now as <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> invited to talk in places that never had ever heard and in houses whose existence would never be <unk>
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use the <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about it."
I didn't know how to talk about it.
I wanted to go to the <unk> and the title of life in a <unk> <unk> -- a grandmother, and two daughters followed the day as they did for almost 20 years, <unk> on the day of every one and a <unk>
And I said to my mom who couldn't do it.
I was reminded that I had now the same age that she was when we arrived at the <unk>
And he would never have been a choice.
And he said, "You don't know what you don't know.
So I talked about <unk> <unk> and education and <unk> to the <unk> and the <unk>
And the more importantly, the more unequal us, the more <unk> it was <unk>
I met people from all the paths of life, so many of them doing what they were going to live in the border of <unk>
And even though I ended up my own, I realized that I couldn't stand in a career of <unk>
I had to have another piece of paper.
And I realized at the same time that it's okay to be a <unk> <unk> in the scene -- and not only that it is something that will be grateful, perhaps a gift of the <unk>
Because being inside you can easily be able to easily say <unk> <unk> can easily mean to be <unk>
And so the good steps were out of my favorite area to know that, yes, the world would be <unk> but not the way we live.
<unk> who didn't have been <unk> were <unk>
There was a energy there, a <unk> <unk> an <unk> mix of humility and <unk>
So I kept my <unk>
And I asked a small group of people for those who <unk> <unk> it was a <unk> challenge <unk>
For a year we didn't have a <unk>
At the end of every day, I made a giant <unk> which all <unk> all <unk>
They were going to go to the <unk>
The majority of our ideas were <unk> but some brilliant luck and we opened it up.
I took the decision to go back to the United States.
after one of a <unk>
My <unk>
Three months later I had <unk> and the adventure <unk>
Before I end up, let me tell you about my <unk>
She grew up in a time where the <unk> was the social rule and the local <unk> it was the person who was <unk>
The life didn't change for granted.
His father died as soon after she died.
The mother grew up.
At 17 it became a <unk> of a <unk> whose mother <unk>
However, support of his husband, he had a <unk> to the <unk> and taking the cause she could, and so much more <unk> had been when he died.
He can't do it to be a <unk>
I was in the room in the middle of a hotel in Pittsburgh when she died, when she died in <unk>
I looked at the <unk> of the <unk> and I saw standing on the other side.
I knew that I had come to <unk>
My mother called minutes later.
And we went to a <unk> temple in <unk> and sat around their <unk> and sat around their <unk>
We have the stories and we make sure we were even with it.
On the night a <unk> came and told us that I had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to make her hand.
I asked the <unk> "Why your hand is cold and the rest of the body as <unk>
They know they have taken their hand from the <unk>
They don't have <unk>
If there is a mutation in our family, that runs through women.
Because we were and how life comes to us, we can now see that men who have come to our lives would have <unk>
The teacher would have <unk>
Now I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about the <unk>
Who might want you to do that for you.
However, I'm afraid to the privilege of what it is.
So I can give you a <unk> in your lives, which is <unk> in each other, <unk> heart rate -- the vast rate of <unk> the vast rate of <unk>
I don't know.
But if I could give you and see what I would do, I would do it.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of this is here in the fourth or four months.
My story begins in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the sky, with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were aware of how nothing has changed from the age of ancient <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In those days when we were we wanted to travel <unk> to a car and put them down the line.
Now what we do with <unk>
In that time when I <unk> the big prince said, "I had a little <unk> I took a arch and with a <unk> and a <unk>
Now we do the same with <unk> and <unk>
The conclusion that we took it out of the <unk>
And that makes me <unk>
Every time I felt a little bit more than <unk>
And I would say, this idea of lose the ability to enjoy and appreciate a party, if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't get my friends.
It seemed to me that technology had to allow the right, not to make sure that it didn't work.
And so my grandfather asked me to do his <unk>
And this piece about 50 years ago was for me to go back to my <unk>
It became a real door to a world full of images, and I would go back into my life.
I had the feeling that the cell phone, the luxury of luxury and cameras, would keep them <unk>
<unk> our <unk>
And so I'm going to show you this technological world to see how we use that to make sure that we use to make sure we can use it to work.
And I asked myself for the first 16 years.
And so when I saw the door, I saw a <unk> device able to connect the readers of the entire world.
You can know how we take the book, and you can know how it works.
So where we are.
So the text with the picture, the sound and the <unk>
The <unk> it becomes increasingly <unk>
But why does it work?
I'm about to launch <unk> an interactive app for you.
He picks up your toes on each other.
And this is --  He said, "This box makes my name <unk> I write my name <unk>
And so I'm going to talk about a character of the book.
In several times I get a <unk> -- the <unk> knows where I live for GPS -- which comes to the GPS <unk>
My girl inside of all of these <unk>
I've been talking a lot of things.
And I don't mean a little bit about it, and it's going to be that magic of childhood, to those ideas that <unk>
For some reason, children in a jar were always taken up to me.
So here you have to <unk> the balls to liberate the <unk>
And in fact, it flies your way into what the whole book is.
The other idea that I was interested in a little girl was that all a galaxy in a <unk>
So here, every book and every world is converted into a <unk> that I <unk> to this <unk> device within the <unk>
And this opens up a <unk>
In the whole book, we have always been maps but have been maps of <unk>
This is a map that comes out -- and you help them for the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book, it will also be <unk>
Now I'm going to talk about this.
Another very important aspect to me is to create <unk> content, and the time it comes to <unk>
These are the <unk>
Now we've all heard of the <unk> and the <unk> but how many people out of India know their <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the cameras, for millennia, in a old way, in a old way.
So we are bringing back in a story of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In a story that this is the current issue as the climate crisis we have.
And talking about the economic crisis, one of the problems over the last 10 years has been that children have been able to get them to their <unk> they haven't come to the world.
But now with new technology, we can take our children to the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure where we have to go back to the outside, take the camera or put images of different objects in different objects like this.
And so I had a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
For some reason children don't do it.
So to bring this <unk> campaign to go back and, in a nutshell, a picture of a flower to a flower and then <unk>
In other words, you have to take a picture of a piece of prefrontal cortex, and then <unk> <unk>
So this is a collection of pictures that then you can put on the Web.
A child in London put a picture of a <unk> and says, "Oh, today, I saw a <unk>
A child from India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a new collection of digital videos that have gone back to us.
In the <unk> of the connection between the right, the Earth and technology are so many things.
In the next book, we have to have an interaction where you go with the <unk> and the video -- and then you really look at a group of <unk> and you see a group of <unk> <unk>
At a time the screen is full of leaves from leaves in the air.
And you have to do the sound of the wind and <unk> to be able to read the rest of the book.
We're going to have a world where the forces of nature become a technology and the magic and the magic and the technology and the technology and the <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We're going to our children and our children in the natural world, and to that point, I'm happy and love and love to sit through a simple story.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
I'd like to talk about why many projects of <unk>
And I think, actually, the most important thing of that is that the most important thing that we left to listen to the patients.
And one of the things that we did at the University of Pittsburgh <unk> was <unk> at one of the <unk>
And not in a very scientific way, she's a small cup of coffee or tea and I asked patients, family and <unk>
What can we do?
And we tend to think that this is one of the biggest problems for what everybody or all, or perhaps all, but most of the projects of <unk> are already going to be that we go out of it.
This is my <unk> <unk> It's a very complex thing.
It has a <unk>
All the time, I would be <unk>
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I got the challenge of getting to 95 percent.
But it's so simple that every time I <unk> it sends my data to Google <unk>
And my doctor in <unk> has access to him as well. So he can see what my problem is, not at the same time in which I would need care of <unk> or some <unk> of that that, but this is the <unk>
But there's another thing.
And as some of you know, I have more than four o'clock in Twitter on Twitter for <unk>
So every morning I connect to my <unk> <unk> and before I go back to my car, people start <unk> <unk> I think you need to be a <unk>
That is the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure pressure used to help patients, because it might be be used for obesity, and also for the patients let patients leave it.
On the other hand, it can be <unk> to move the people of their chairs and together develop some <unk> activity to have more control of their health.
From the next week we will be able to be able to be available from the next week to be able to be available from the next week to be able to be available from the next week to be able to be available from the next week to be able to be available from the next week to be able to be available from the next week to be
So this little <unk> connected to an iPhone or another one.
And people <unk> from their homes, they take their pressure pressure to their doctor, and they will be with each other, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, they come to restore control and to be captains of their own <unk> but also to help care of health care because of the challenges we face, as the root of the quality of the quality of the demand and other needs.
We need techniques that are simple techniques to use and start with this to engage patients in the system.
And they can do it with techniques like this, but also by <unk>
And one of the things that we did was I would like to share with you with a video video with you with a video video with you.
We all have <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Maybe we have to have in our <unk>
We know perfectly where they go into the <unk>
It's also where they're all <unk>
And of course, we can find blood flow from the <unk>
But where is the fastest <unk> to help this <unk>
We asked them to do it.
No one knew where to get the <unk> saves lives at this time.
So what we did was do <unk> in the United States.
We created a web website, and we asked the public <unk> you see a <unk> for favor of <unk> <unk> where, and when it is open because of all the times we go back in a <unk>
And more than 10 <unk> were already introduced in the United States.
The next step was to look at the app for that.
And we did a app for the <unk>
We created an app for <unk> <unk> to find these <unk>
And every time you're in the city of <unk> and someone <unk> you can use your iPhone, and you can use your iPhone, and the next few weeks use your cell phone to find the fastest <unk>
And from today, I'd like to introduce this -- not just as <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also as <unk>
And we would be able to go back to the global level.
We're <unk> all the colleagues in the world, in other places for us to help find, and act as a center for the <unk> in the world.
Every time you go from vacation and someone <unk> it can be a relative or someone in front of you, you can see it.
I also want to invite companies around the world that they could help us <unk> these <unk>
They might be services, or <unk> people of <unk> for example, to see if the <unk> which is still in their place -- is still in their place.
Please, <unk> in this and not only improve health, but take control of it.
Thank you. Thank you.
I'm here to share with you the <unk>
Or is <unk> <unk> <unk>
Because, of course, they're photographs that can't take with their <unk>
My interest in photography was woke up with my first digital camera to the 15 years.
And so I went to my passion before the drawing but it was a little different because by using the camera process was in the <unk>
And when you take a photograph with a camera -- the process ends up when it comes to the <unk>
And for me the photograph had more to be in the right place at the right time at the time.
I felt that anyone could do it.
So I wanted to create something different -- a process that started to press the <unk>
<unk> like this: a building in a very <unk> way.
But it has a <unk>
And despite that, it takes a level of <unk>
Or pictures like <unk> dark and <unk> but with the common goal to keep the quality of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And when I say <unk> I say <unk> <unk>
Because, of course, it's not something that I can do, but I always want you to think that it looks like this.
<unk> where you have to think a moment to discover the <unk>
It has more to capture a sense that with capture a few times.
But what is the trick that you look at.
It's the details, or the <unk>
<unk> <unk>
What is it that creates the <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is the illusion that the illusion is.
But at the end of our way, it is about our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive in a <unk> surface.
It is actually not about whether it's realistic but of what we think is possible.
And so I think the <unk> are very simple things.
I see it as a concept of the reality that we take different parts of the reality and we put them to create a physical reality to create a physical reality process.
Let me show you an example here.
So here we have three different objects -- something that we all can do with the <unk>
But also, in some ways you can create something that still seems to be <unk> as if it comes to <unk>
But at the same time, we know that it doesn't exist.
So <unk> in the brain because the brain is not aware of the fact that that really doesn't have any sense.
And I see the same process to combine the <unk>
It doesn't really work in combine these <unk>
And the things that make a picture looks serious -- I think they're those who don't even understand the things that are surrounding us in our lives.
But to combine pictures is very important -- because of another way that something else is going on.
And so I would like to say that there are three simple rules that will continue to get rid of it.
As you can see, these images are not very useful.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of pictures must have the same idea.
Secondly, the pictures <unk> should have the same kind of light.
And these two images come with these <unk> they were taken at the same height and with the same kind of light.
The third point is to make it impossible to explain the principle and the end of the different images with a <unk>
It has to be impossible to see where the image.
This is another example.
I could think that this is the image of a landscape, and the bottom part is <unk>
But this image is totally filled with photographs of different places.
And so I think it's easier to create a place that it is, because you don't need to put the ideas in your head the ideas in your head.
But it requires a lot of <unk>
And as I thought this idea in winter knew that I had a number of months to find the different parts of the <unk>
For example, the fish was captured in a <unk> trip to <unk>
The coast of a different location is a different.
The <unk> was released in a <unk> of <unk>
And yes, I even made red at the top of the island of the island so that it would be more <unk>
So to get a free outcome I think does need <unk>
I always start with a <unk> idea.
And then you have to combine the different <unk>
And here every piece is very well <unk>
If you make a good job to take the pictures that can be very beautiful, and rather than the very <unk>
All the tools are there and the only limit is our experience of our lives.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
I'm going to show you a slide about technology, very quickly.
please, if you can <unk>
This is a diagram that I took from a <unk>
I don't want to show you the details of the details, but the general truth is the general aspect of the <unk>
This is a analysis that we were doing about the power of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> versus the power of the solar system.
The interesting thing about this is that this is that this is that this is a kind of a <unk> in <unk>
In other words, every step of here represents an order of magnitude in the <unk> of <unk>
I'm going to talk about technology with curves to <unk>
Here is a thing called a <unk>
And that's why I'm going to talk about you.
please, let me show you.
<unk> more intensity because writing about paper.
Why are <unk> curves in <unk> <unk>
The answer is that if you put them in a normal curve where you say, these are the years, or some unit of time, and this would be any of the technology that I'd like to show you the diagram would look like something different.
It would be something like this.
It doesn't tell you a lot about it.
But if you <unk> for example, some other technology, like <unk> on a curve, it would be a very complicated line, you would see a <unk>
But if you look at something like this, it gives you a <unk> change for you.
If the technology of the transport of the transport of the transport is as quickly as the <unk> last morning we could take a <unk> and be in <unk>
But it's not going to be that <unk>
There are no economic development in the history of a technological growth than every few years of <unk> <unk> <unk>
The thing that I want to show you is -- if these curves are <unk> we see that they're not going to work.
It's not going to support this change as fast as possible.
It was one of two things.
Or it becomes a typical curve -- I know how this until I get something completely different -- or maybe it will be something like this.
That's all that you can do it. That's what it looks like.
I'm a neuroscientist, so I think maybe something like this.
So now we would be in the middle of a <unk>
In this line we're in a transition from what used to be the world, to a new way.
So what I'm trying to ask and ask is: What is that new way to get the <unk>
So what new state is going on.
The transition seems very, very simple, if we are engaged in it.
I remember the future of the future of year and people used to talk about what would happen in the year 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future and we see that the future continues to be the year 2000.
That's all that we see what we see.
In other words, the future has been <unk> year after year, my life.
But I think it should be that something is going on.
And that happens to be a <unk>
And we know that it doesn't have a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years because everything will be as different -- what we're doing today doesn't have any sense.
So I want to talk to you about how it might be, how it might be that transition that <unk>
But to do that, I will have to talk a little bit about things that don't have a lot to do with technology and another.
Because I think the only way to understand is taking distance and looking at the things throughout the long term.
The scale of time in which I would like to do this is the time of life on Earth.
I think this image has sense if we look at each billion years ago.
So we go back about two billion years ago when the Earth was a big rock with many chemicals that would go out to your side.
If you look at the way that you look at these chemicals we give us a sense of how it happens, things like things.
And I think there are theories to start to understand the origin of what it is, I'm going to tell you a simple version of this, and that's that, at that time, there were a lot of <unk> of oil with all kinds of recipes in your brain.
Some of those <unk> <unk> <unk> a particular combination of chemicals that were made out of the outside of the outside and so on.
And they started to <unk>
In a sense, those were the different forms of <unk> those <unk> <unk>
But those <unk> were not <unk> in the past, because every one of them produced a chemical recipe of <unk> <unk>
And every time you <unk> <unk> a <unk> distribution of chemicals that are <unk>
So every <unk> was a little different.
In fact, the ones that somehow get better at the time to incorporate the chemicals -- <unk> more <unk> <unk> more chemicals and <unk> more <unk>
Even more importantly, they were more <unk>
It was a form of life, a very simple way but things got interesting when these shrimp were the trick of the <unk>
So anyway, we don't understand very well that these <unk> learned to store information.
We need to save information that was the recipe for the cell in a special chemical called <unk>
In other words, <unk> in this particular evolution system that allowed them to paint what they were to be able to be able to be able to <unk>
So the amazing thing is that that system of writing seems to be completely stable since millions billion years ago.
Our recipe, our recipe, is exactly the same code, that same system of <unk>
In fact, every human being sold with exactly the same set of letters and the same thing.
And one of the things I did is just for <unk> now we can write things with this <unk>
So here I have 100 <unk> of white powder that I try to hide the <unk> people of the <unk>
But I <unk> I took this <unk> and it has the code that we tend to use in this, and I wrote my personal data on this little piece of DNA in this little piece of DNA in the <unk>
So if someone wants 100 million copies of my personal card I have a lot of <unk> in fact, for every person in the world and is here.
If it was a <unk> he would have put it in a virus and would would have <unk> in the room.
What was the next <unk>
To explain DNA was a very interesting question.
This did these cells were happy to be a billion years ago.
But then the one big step in which things are going to be very different and it was that these cells started to share and communicate information on the other side.
I don't know if you know it, but the bacteria can take <unk> <unk>
And so for example, for example, it evolved resistance to the <unk>
Some bacteria found the way of avoiding the shape and the <unk> to create their little DNA with other bacteria and now there are many, many <unk> because the bacteria are going to be <unk> because the bacteria are <unk>
So this communication, communication gave us a place where we were able to create communities that, in a way, they were together in <unk>
And so <unk> or <unk> together, or whether a community was very successful all the individuals in that community would be <unk> more and more <unk> for the sake of evolution.
And the point in that happened when these communities came up so much so much and they decided to write all the recipe for the community of the community board in a <unk>
The next stage of life took a billion years ago.
And in that stage, we have <unk> communities of many types of different cells, working together as a single <unk>
In fact, we are a community <unk>
We have a lot of cells that we already need to be <unk>
The skin cell is not the heart cell, or the <unk> or the <unk> of the brain, and so on.
So these communities evolved and made more interesting levels that the cell phone, something we call a <unk>
The next level happened within these <unk>
These started <unk>
And to build very special structures that we didn't do more to process information in community.
It's the <unk> structures that are <unk>
The neurons are the ones that make the information that we make up the information that these communities are.
In fact, they started <unk> inside of the community being responsible for <unk> to understand how the information works.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those walls, and the nervous system was <unk>
And that gave them a big advantage to <unk>
Because in that moment as <unk> <unk> was at the speed of a organism, and not the time of the time it is.
So an organism could, for example, to learn not eating some fish because they knew bad and they would ask the last time that <unk>
That could happen during the life of a organism given that before they had built these structures of information that the evolution would have learned over hundreds of thousands of years ago by death of individuals who ate that fish from the <unk>
So the fact that the fact that the nervous system built these structures of information changed by the natural process.
Because evolution could now be a full <unk>
It could happen in the time we need to learn about it.
But then, of course, of course, the individuals found the trick of violence.
So for example, the more <unk> version that we know is the human language.
So if we think about it, it's an incredible invention of incredible success.
I have a very complicated idea, a very complicated idea in my head.
I'm sitting here sitting in a <unk> and, again, building a similar idea and <unk> in your head that it takes a certain analogy with mine.
But we take a very complicated thing in sound, and we produce something very complicated in another brain, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
So now that allows us to start to work as a <unk>
In fact, as humanity, we've started doing <unk>
So now we spend for periods of time, similar to the organisms that we have, our methods of <unk> presentation and processing information.
For example, the invention of language was a small step in that direction.
The <unk> the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> are the molecular mechanisms that we now build to make that information.
And that leads us into something much more big, faster and capable of doing before.
Now evolution can happen in <unk>
You know, the <unk> <unk> <unk> in which it produced some evolution with the <unk> program to our eyes.
And now we've been doing the scales of time again.
The first stages of the story that I would tell you about a billion years ago every one of you every single one.
Now, the next few of the <unk> and the brain, took about hundreds of millions of years.
The <unk> language, and it took less than a million years ago.
And the time, as the electronics, seems to take a few decades.
The process is <unk> I guess that <unk> is the right word to put something that makes her own heart rate of change.
The more changes, the more changes it is.
And I think that's what we look at in this explosion of <unk>
We see that the process is <unk>
But I put my life designing computers and I know the mechanisms that work for them would not be possible without the scientific breakthroughs in the developing world.
But now design objects that it would be impossible for me to be able to make a good way to get a <unk>
I don't know that every transistor in that machine is going on in that machine in a second.
There are thousands of dollars.
Instead of that, with the designers of <unk> <unk> we think that we put it into the machine and the machine that makes something that before you can't could, it gets far more and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes the methods that we don't even understand good.
A particularly interesting method that I've been using here is the evolution of it.
We put in the machine a mathematical process that works on the scale of the <unk>
And for example, in the most sophisticated cases, we can operate a program from a random sequence of species.
And we say, "No, no, you can run a hundred billion of them in the <unk>
You could get these sequences of instructions at random, put all those programs, and take those other programs, and take those more <unk> to what we want to do.
In other words, I define what it looks like.
Let's say I want to give you numbers, to put a simple example of a simple example to put a simple example of it.
So we find the programs that are more <unk> and so we see them.
And of course, it's unlikely that a few random sequences of <unk> <unk> numbers, so no one of them did it.
But again, luckily, he could find two numbers on the order right right now.
And I said, <unk> you could take 10 percent of those random sequences that better did the <unk>
And I would put those and <unk> to the <unk>
And now <unk> the ones that best <unk>
And let's go back to <unk> following a <unk> process by <unk> <unk> <unk>
So let me show you two problems, which <unk> children, who are <unk> and that the children are both <unk>
So we have a new generation of programs in the combinations of programs that had a bit more success.
And we said, "Why don't you take the <unk>
<unk>
So what does it do?
And it tries to go back and try and try and try and make a new thing.
Well, every generation takes a few minutes.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes or, in a few minutes in a few months.
In the end, we end up with programs that we <unk> numbers so that it was absolutely hard enough.
In fact, they're a lot more efficient than that I could have written out there.
If I look at those programs I can't tell you about how it works.
I've tried to ask them to see how it works.
This is <unk> <unk>
But it's the <unk>
In fact, I have the security security of the goal because they come from a million of thousands of thousands of programs that I have.
In fact, their lives would be <unk>
So once I was in a <unk> with <unk> <unk> and you got a card and put me up with this.
He says, <unk> plane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> who work together to offer a flight <unk> I don't feel like <unk>
We know that the engineering processes don't work very well when it comes to <unk>
And so we started to depend on computers to make a different design model.
And that allows us to produce much more complex things that causes the normal engineering exchange that makes the normal <unk>
However, we don't understand all the choices that we have.
In that sense, it's in front of us.
Now we use these programs to make computers much more efficient, and so we can get these programs much more quickly.
I mean, it would be <unk>
The thing goes faster and so I think it seems like <unk> <unk>
Because all these technologies are <unk>
We're <unk>
And we are at a moment where we are going to <unk> <unk> when they came to <unk>
We are the <unk> and we can't understand what the hell we are doing.
We're at the point of view.
But I think that something comes out of us.
I think it would be very shy of our part of our thinking that we are the ultimate product of evolution.
And I think we all are part of the creation of what's going on.
But now comes at the Princeton and I think that before I put me up here before I put me <unk>
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that must change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that I'm my first talk to you about this one.
And I've spent time enough to be part of a part of my false friends.
Before the subject of my talk, we talk a little bit about this.
Why not?
We're close to the end, it's going to be the <unk>
We love it.
The baseball is full of statistics from the <unk>
There are hundreds of them.
This is because of <unk> <unk> talks about the statistics and use to form a great team of <unk>
I'm going to focus on one of them and I hope that many of you are <unk>
It's called the average of <unk>
And we talk about 20 percent of a <unk> that <unk> <unk>
That means that the <unk> <unk> three times.
That means to launch the ball of game without being <unk> and that anyone who will be able to do it at the first time, I don't go to time, and the second database will be <unk>
3 <unk> <unk>
You know how you call a <unk> of 300 in the Great <unk>
Well, really, really, good -- maybe the team of the stars in the world.
You know how you call a <unk> <unk> of <unk>
By the way, that is someone that about 10 <unk>
And <unk> like the <unk> Ted Company, the last one of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> in a <unk> season in a <unk> <unk>
Now <unk> this to my work in medicine where I feel much more comfortable or perhaps less than one of which I will tell you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and you're <unk> to a surgeon who has an article in <unk> in <unk>
So it doesn't work, right?
Now suppose you live in a place, and a little bit of a little bit of two <unk> <unk> <unk> and your doctor doctor is going to be a <unk> which is in <unk>
But, you know what?
She is paying for this year this year this year.
And their <unk> have been <unk> and their <unk>
This is not <unk>
But I'll tell you about that.
What do you believe you should be the average of a heart attack, or a heart attack or a <unk> or a <unk>
Watson.
And the truth of the issue is that nobody in medicine knows the best part of a doctor or a <unk>
So what we do, though, is that it's <unk> the world, and I would love to be able to be <unk>
That I had to make a mistake and try to figure out how to do it right.
That was the message that <unk> when I was in medical school.
I was a graduate student <unk>
One time, a fellow in high school said that Brian Sachs was studied until for a new test test for a <unk> <unk>
Maybe <unk>
<unk> in my small <unk> in the nurses of nurses from the nurses of the Nobel Prize in <unk>
And I learned all of my personal experiences.
From my <unk> <unk> <unk> the origin of every vessel that comes out of every vessel that comes out of the <unk> which comes out of the <unk>
And I even knew the diagnosis of how to get the <unk> <unk>
And as it <unk> more and more knowledge.
And I was very lucky enough to do it.
And <unk> of medicine with medicine with the impression that if you will, everything, then you know everything, or the most possible thing to do, because so I'm going to give you the <unk>
And it worked for a while, until I met the lady <unk>
I was <unk> in a college hospital here, in Toronto, when they brought the lady to the <unk> where I would do it.
At the time I got to the service of <unk>
And when I went to the <unk> I would ask you to go to that patient to get that patient to that patient to get that patient to that patient to get that patient to that patient to get that patient to that patient to get that patient back to that patient again.
And of course, the head of <unk> and <unk>
When I saw the lady <unk> I was <unk> I was <unk>
I heard a sound <unk>
And when the <unk> I heard a sound <unk> in both sides, which I would show you a <unk> <unk> <unk>
In these conditions, the heart gets to work and, rather than <unk> your blood will go forward, your blood goes into your lungs, and then you have difficulty on your head.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did it and I got to work in the treatment that I would <unk>
And I gave birth and medication to get the pressure on his head.
I gave them <unk> <unk> <unk> so that I could put it out of it.
And in an hour or two, she started to feel better.
And I felt very good.
And there was when I took the first <unk> to his home.
In fact, I would show you two things.
He sent her home without talking with the head of <unk>
I don't raised the phone or I should have what I should have done, which was to call my head and <unk> with him for the <unk>
And if my head would have seen, would have been able to take <unk>
Maybe I did a good thing.
Maybe I didn't want to be a child that would be <unk>
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to take <unk> that might care of my patients without even <unk>
The second thing that I would say was it was different.
At the top of her home, I didn't hear attention to a voice in my inside that I said, <unk> not a good idea.
In fact, I was so happy that until I asked the nurse who was <unk> to the lady who was okay if he goes to his <unk>
And the nurse thought and then he said to the total <unk> "Yes, I think it would be a <unk>
I remember that as it was <unk>
So it was he signed up, and the ambulance along with the owners and they gave her home.
And I went back to the middle of the hospital.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad <unk> in the stomach, in the stomach, the stomach, in the stomach, in the stomach, in the stomach, the stomach, in the stomach, in the stomach, in the stomach, in the stomach, in the stomach, in the stomach, in the stomach, in the stomach, in the stomach, in the stomach, in the stomach, in the stomach, in the stomach,
But I kept with my work.
At the end of the day, I would put the hospital and walked towards the parking car where I was my car to go home.
I spent the service of the way home.
And there is another guy who didn't know what was going on from the lady <unk> before, but one of the three words, those three words that most of the U.S. soldiers were <unk>
Other companies are afraid also, but there's a <unk> in <unk> and it is that we see the patients <unk>
The three words are <unk>
He said, "Well, the patient sent his <unk>
I asked the other person with total <unk>
So she would be <unk> with the same piece of voice.
She was right.
But I went back and on the edge of the death.
By an hour of having come back to her home, after I give him a collapse and her family and her family called the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> with an pressure pressure of <unk> which means a <unk>
And so I was there.
The staff of emergency dance are all <unk>
They gave them medication to get the pressure pressure to go pressure on the pressure pressure to feed the pressure pressure to get pressure pressure to catch the pressure pressure to get your blood pressure pressure to get your blood pressure pressure to get your blood pressure pressure to get your pressure pressure to get your blood pressure pressure to get your pressure pressure to get your pressure pressure to
And they put a <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> until the <unk>
He had an feelings of feelings because after the <unk> were in therapy and expected to all hope that they would be <unk>
And in the two or three days of the next few days it was obvious that we never <unk>
He had a mental illness.
The family has been invited from the family to bring the family together to bring the family back into the family.
And in eight days, they would be <unk> what was happening in and in the middle of it.
And the ninth day, the left to go back the lady --  -- mother and <unk>
They say that they never forget the names of those who have to get the names of the ones that they want.
That was my first <unk>
The few weeks ago, I asked me for it and I experienced for the first time the <unk> shame that exists in our medical culture and I sat down without feeling that shame because you can't afford to be <unk>
So you make the peace and never put it into that <unk>
It's that shame that you put a <unk>
The shame of what I talk about is what makes us feel very bad at all.
It's what tells us that what we did was not that what we did was, but we're willing to do it.
And that <unk>
And it wasn't because of my <unk> he was a <unk>
I spoke to the family and I'm sure that I would take the things and make sure that I didn't do it.
And I kept asking those questions.
Why don't I ask my <unk> why I sent him to his <unk>
And in my worst <unk> why would I make a mistake so <unk>
why I <unk>
<unk> to a little bit of that feeling was <unk>
And I started to feel better.
And in one day, he opened up the sky, and eventually came back and asked me if I would be better and more again.
And I did a deal with me in which if you were to <unk> the efforts to be perfect for not to make it easier to make it <unk> those <unk>
And so <unk>
I came to <unk>
But it turned out that it was going to happen.
Two years later, I was diagnosed in the emergency department in a hospital hospital in New York and I got to a man in New York City with a <unk>
I was very busy and <unk> and <unk>
And he came here.
I watched her job, he was a little <unk>
He sent him up and sent him to her home.
But as he went to the door, he was going to the door to the <unk>
Two days later, when I came to make my <unk> <unk> my son asked me to talk to me <unk> in his head.
And it was three words: <unk> <unk>
It turns out to the patient who saw by a pain in <unk>
And he came back and I didn't have a <unk>
He had a heart attack called <unk> <unk>
You can do it. It's an infection, not about it, but of course it goes down, but it can cause the <unk> of those <unk>
So luckily, we don't <unk>
It was <unk> antibiotics for going to be <unk> and <unk> and <unk> to the few days.
And the same time of shame and <unk> then I went back to work, and I went to work, until it happened again, and again and again and again again.
Two times in the same turn -- not <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And this is a great student, especially working in a hospital, already in a hospital, already at 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't put home and I don't think it's a <unk>
One of them I thought I had a <unk> <unk>
And it turned out to be a <unk> but it turned out a colleague who was looking at the patient who was looking at the patient at the bottom of the <unk>
The other patient was with a lot of <unk>
And I put liquid liquid to <unk> and asked my colleague who did the <unk>
And I went to the right to see some sensitivity in the lower right, called the <unk>
Both of them were born and they were doing very well.
But every case I'm going to show you <unk>
But I'd like to tell you that I would take the worst errors in the first five years of exercise and as many colleagues say, it's a <unk>
The most meaningful thing have been over the last five years.
<unk> <unk> and without <unk>
And here is the problem: if I can't hear it, and I'm going to talk about myself if I can't find the <unk> I say what I'm going to do, how you can share this with my <unk>
How do I teach you this for the same <unk>
If I could go back to a place like this, I would have a sense of what you think about me.
When it was the last time you heard someone who would talk about it: after that, after 9/11, it was <unk>
So of course, that in a party to talk about the errors of other doctors, but not to remind someone of their own <unk>
And if I knew and my colleagues also, that a <unk> in my hospital -- the wrong leg -- I think I would have a kind of <unk>
This is the system that we have.
The total <unk> of <unk> <unk>
It's the system in which there are two <unk> which we do and the ones that you can't sleep and the ones that have <unk> outcomes and the ones that have been <unk>
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction as antibodies that start to attack that person.
So we have the idea that if you go from medicine to the people who make us a spiritual system.
But that gives two problems.
In 20 years of <unk> and journalism -- I've done a personal study of bad <unk> and medical models to learn what possible, from the first article that I wrote for the first article I wrote for <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And what I learned is that the errors are <unk>
We work in a system where the errors happen every day, where one of every 10 drugs <unk> in the hospital are wrong, or <unk> is not right -- in a system where <unk> <unk> are increasingly and more <unk>
In this country, they die 24 hours a lot of medical errors <unk>
The Global Institute set 100 <unk>
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we are not <unk> the problem as possible.
And so they're doing things.
A <unk> system where knowledge is going to happen every two or three years, and we are not <unk>
The design of the dream is all <unk>
And we can't get rid of it.
So we have the evidence that allow to make a perfect history of a patient with pain in the <unk>
Now, let's take the same patient with a pain in his chest, comes out with <unk> eyes and leave them with alcohol and suddenly, my story would be <unk>
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do the things to be a <unk>
And my patients are not going to be able to get their symptoms up in the same way.
All of this, the errors are <unk>
So if we take the system as we take the system as we do, and we take all of the professional forms of <unk>
And with that, people don't want to talk about their <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In my <unk> <unk> <unk> Art <unk> is already a habit saying, "This is my worst <unk> I would say all of them until the <unk> <unk> blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.
And their students are <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and they're going to tell their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to be <unk>
They would be able to say, "Look, don't get the same <unk>
They need a context where they can do it.
They need a medical culture <unk>
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The medical doctor is human, you know human it, and it's not enough of their mistakes, but it's going to be to learn how to learn about what happens to me.
And I would say their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their <unk>
And so the errors of other people not with <unk> but in a <unk> way, and of support for all of the <unk>
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that human beings have the system, and when this happens, it would be the mistakes of the same thing.
My name is Brian <unk> <unk> <unk>
I am a doctor <unk>
I'm a human being.
And I feel a lot of effort to learn something that can convey to each other.
I don't know what you think about me, but I can live with that.
And let me introduce you with three words <unk> I would like it to do it.
Do you know how many decisions we take a day <unk>
Do you know what you would do in a <unk>
I just did a survey to more than 2,000 people and the average amount of choices that says to be an American American man, they're about 70 percent.
It's not a lot of research in a research project during a week to a foreign group of American government.
Now, the researchers took the different tasks of these executives and the time that we were going to make decisions about those <unk>
They found that, in average, <unk> <unk> works for week.
You know, every work of a lot of <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
And only one of the things required an hour or more of their time.
Now you think about your <unk>
Do you know how about the category of nine minutes, and how many of you have a <unk>
So how do we <unk> the way that we create those <unk>
So today, I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of the <unk> choice of <unk>
I want to talk about the problem and how much possible we can do it.
As I talk about this, I'm going to give you a few questions and I need to know your answers to your attention.
When you do a question, like I'm going to raise your hand only if you want to burn it.
In another way, when you do a question, if your response is positive for favor of a <unk>
And now my first question of the day, they're ready to hear about the problem of <unk> <unk>
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
In graduate school at the University of Stanford, I would put this place in the very, very long time in that time in that time it was very exciting.
It's called <unk> <unk>
It was almost like going to a <unk> park in <unk>
There were about 250 different types of tests and <unk> more than 500 different types of fruits and vegetables and about 25 percent of water, and this was when it was when it was the <unk>
I loved going to go to that shop, but in one occasion, I asked me why I never bought it.
This is the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk>
They had more than 75 different kinds of different kinds different types including the ones that were in <unk>
I once decided to visit the movie, and I asked them to take all of these <unk> <unk> all these <unk>
And he asked me to sign the cars full of millions of days, usually with their <unk>
We decided to make a small experiment with the <unk> This is the <unk>
<unk>
They had a different type of different types of different types of different kinds of different types of different types of different types of different kinds of different kinds of different types of different types of physical media.
And then a <unk> for <unk> just at the bottom of the Atlantic.
We put it out of six <unk> or about 24 hours a different -- and we look at two things: First, where the people were willing to stop it, to try to figure out it.
More people stopped when there were <unk> a hundred years ago that when there were only six, one percent.
We also look at what case they were more likely to buy a <unk> <unk>
Here we find the exact effect of the Internet.
So what happened was when there were <unk> only three to buy <unk>
So when we were six, we saw that 30 percent bought <unk> <unk>
If we do the calculations, people would have six times more probability of buying <unk> if they found out that if they were <unk>
Well, to decide that we don't buy <unk> we will probably be able to get <unk> -- less is good to get the <unk> but it turns out that the problem of the <unk> of choices are really <unk>
We decided, even when we do this, even when we do that, we don't <unk>
Now the subject of the day, the savings rate is right now.
I'm going to tell you a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we look at the decisions about savings -- for example, about a million Americans, from a million Americans, from this country.
We were interested in looking at if the number of funds were available in business plans for retirement, to protect the program <unk> to people to save the future.
And we found that there was actually a <unk> <unk>
We had plans for plans that they were from two, and they needed smart choices better.
We found that the largest number was the number of <unk> there were less <unk>
So if we look at the <unk> we see that in the plans that they offer two percent, the rate of participation was 70 percent, not as high as possible.
And in the plans that were about 60 percent, we would be about 60 percent.
It turns out that even if you decide whether there's more choices, even in that case, there are <unk> <unk> <unk>
So for the people who decided to reduce the number of choices, more people would be able to avoid the actions of the actions or the medical care funds or access of stress.
In the way we have more choices, they were more willing to invest in the stock market.
But none of these basic decisions are the ones that we are, to optimize the financial value future.
In the previous decade we've seen three major unintended consequences to offer more and more quickly.
The most likely thing is that <unk> the decision that the <unk> even when this is in the own world.
This is more likely to take the worst <unk> in medicine, and in the future.
They are more likely to pick things less <unk> even though they're going to be better.
The main reason is that we will be able to look at that database of <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the math, but we need to do the math, and we pick out of that magnificent <unk>
So today, I want to show you four simple techniques that we've been doing in a way or another, in different research so that you can test them on their own.
The first is, <unk> <unk>
You know, you've heard before, but it's never been more true than today, which less is more.
People are always passionate about when I say, <unk> <unk>
They care about losing space in the <unk>
But really, what we're looking at every time is that if you decide to be able to get rid of smart choices there will be an increase in <unk> <unk> costs, there will be a better experience in the <unk>
So when you go to <unk> & <unk> spent about 26 different types of <unk> & <unk> you saw a number of 10 percent reduction in diameter.
When the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> that less than less <unk> are <unk> in <unk> for two <unk> <unk> and <unk>
You know that the <unk> of today, in average they offer 45 billion dollars.
In a grocery store, you pay about 100,000 dollars, and you have about 100,000 dollars.
But the <unk> store in the current world is <unk> and it's just <unk> <unk> a type of spaghetti sauce of <unk>
In the world of financial savings -- I think one of the best examples that have happened about how to deal with the choices is the argument of David <unk> the program of <unk>
All the Harvard are going to go from Harvard -- they automatically put up in a certain amount of life.
And the people who really want to go to the <unk> they provide 20 or more.
You know, you know that sometimes people say, "I don't know like <unk> <unk>
All of these are <unk>
So the first thing that I do is ask the <unk> <unk> the differences that there are between those <unk>
And if your employees can't <unk> you can't do it.
And this afternoon, before I start this session, I went to <unk>
He told me that she would be willing to offer people of this audience a few weeks with all day to the most beautiful road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want you to do it.
I'm going to leave you a few seconds for <unk> and then I want you to go to a <unk> if you're ready to take the <unk>
<unk> <unk> No. Any one of you who is ready to take the <unk>
They're not happy, they're not.
Well, I'm going to show you some more.
You knew that there was a <unk>
Who is ready for that <unk>
I think I really had to hear more questions.
Very good.
Actually, you had more information in the first <unk> that in the <unk> but I can say that the second time it was more real <unk>
Because the images were made to be more real <unk>
This leads me to the second technique that the problem of <unk> which is <unk> which is <unk>
For people to understand the differences between choices, they have to understand the consequences of every option, and that the consequences should be very <unk> very <unk>
Why are people spend 30 percent more than 30 percent more in average when they use clothing and credit, which when they use <unk>
Because it doesn't seem money for real money because it doesn't seem money.
It turns out that the most real <unk> can be a very positive tool for people to do more.
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who worked in <unk> these people were in a meeting where they were <unk> to a <unk>
In that meeting, that <unk> exactly like <unk> we did a little <unk>
So what we found was that it would be a personal staff that would think about the positive things that we would take in their lives if we took more money.
With this <unk> there was an increase in the <unk> 20 percent increase in the amount that they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put in their <unk> of <unk>
The third technique is <unk>
We can make more categories that we need to do more than that.
So for example, this is a study that we did in a <unk> in <unk>
So we saw that in the middle, we found out that in the <unk> of the <unk> the <unk> of magazines can contain from <unk> different types of <unk>
But, you know?
Because the event tells me how to <unk>
These are two <unk> <unk> <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other <unk>
If you think about the left is <unk> and the right of the right is <unk>
<unk> <unk> Well, there are <unk>
If you think about the left is <unk> and the right of the right is <unk>
Well, some more.
It turns out that it's right now.
On the left is <unk> and the right of the right is <unk> but you know what? But you know what?
This process of <unk> is completely different.
The categories should say something to be <unk> not as the <unk>
You often see this problem with these huge <unk> of <unk>
So let me tell you who are <unk>
My fourth <unk>
It turns out that we can make a lot more information than what we think about if you just <unk> a little bit.
We have to increase the complexity of nature.
I'm going to show you an example of what I want to say to say about what I want to say to say about what I want to say.
Let's look at a good job, you buy a car for a car, look at a car.
This is a German German manufacturer that allows them to be <unk>
You have to take 60 decisions to read the <unk>
And these decisions vary in the number of choices that leads to each one of one one.
<unk> color of the car in the car, I have <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
So what I'm going to do is to be <unk> the order that you have in that way.
So half of the customers are going to go out of a lot of choices, 35 pieces of <unk> -- four <unk>
On the other half of the customers are going to go from a few choices, four minutes later, a lot of <unk>
And what I'm going to do is <unk>
What about <unk>
If you have a <unk> button in every decision, this tells you that they're <unk> or <unk> we are <unk> we're <unk>
What we found is that the ones that are in a lot of a lot of <unk> <unk> the button and again, and another more.
<unk> <unk>
If you go from a few choices to many, continue there.
The same information, the same number of things.
So the only thing I did was to alter the order of the information that comes from.
If we started with the easy, you learn to <unk>
Even if you pick the box box of changes -- not just about the <unk> of the <unk> of all of us, we will be able to do it.
We're excited about a product that we are building that we now have more <unk> with the process.
So for example.
I've been talking about four techniques to address the problem of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- we can make more categories with less <unk>
All these techniques that I've showed you were designed to help save the <unk> or better, for you, to use them in their own business, or for the people who were <unk>
This is that the key to get the key to get the best of a choice is to be <unk>
And the more importantly, the more we will be in our choices, we can focus the art of consciousness.
Thank you. Thank you.
In the '60s, in New York City, if you had a machine to write a machine to write <unk>
It had to put a piece of text from example with the <unk>
And this for the government could track the origin of the <unk>
If they found a game with the message with the message to the origin of the idea.
In the West, we don't think that someone could do this, what a lot of you would do, the freedom of <unk>
We can't do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser printer from any big <unk> and it makes a page, that page would end up having a little bit of <unk> in every page that will get a pattern from one and a half of your <unk>
So that's happening today.
And nobody seems to be <unk> so much for this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology in our society, the <unk> citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems in the network.
If you look at what happens in the world in the world in the world we can take the <unk>
There's three groups <unk>
They're <unk>
And Mr. <unk> <unk> from the city of <unk> in <unk>
The mobile phone is very easy to do it.
These are these types of money.
They use the <unk> to make a lot of money, <unk> <unk>
There are really many cases of <unk> online, <unk> that <unk> money with their <unk>
This is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and so on.
These guys are doing their <unk> in line but they do it by illegal legal systems, by stealing money for stealing money when they buy them in <unk> or they can get information from our balls to get information from our email when they buy a computer <unk>
The secret to the United States has two months ago, <unk> the <unk> of this <unk> Sam <unk> and this would have <unk> millions of dollars when it was <unk>
Mr. <unk> <unk> <unk> you don't know their <unk>
And I say that today is more likely that any of us is victim of a real <unk>
And it's very obvious that this is going to be different.
In the future, most of the deaths in it.
So the second group of <unk> in the importance of <unk> is not driven by money.
There is another thing that the <unk> would tell you about the protests, I gave them the <unk>
In terms of <unk> they have <unk> in the last 12 months, including a <unk> role in <unk>
Those are the three <unk> the three <unk> birds who do what they do for money, and the <unk> as they do it to compete and the last group are the national and the U.S.
And then we see cases like <unk>
That is a good example of a police attack against their own citizens.
<unk> is an authority of the United States -- or, really, what it looks like.
And the last fall, because of a <unk>
And I would argue the security of the site and <unk> a <unk>
The week I asked him at a meeting with the U.S. government, and I asked one of the leaders if we were <unk> the death of the people of the attack to <unk>
And the answer of him was yes.
So how people die people from a heart attack from a <unk>
<unk> is an authority <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
So why are they <unk>
Well, you need if you have a website with <unk> services, services like <unk> services like <unk>
Except I would take a <unk> authority to <unk> <unk>
And that <unk> <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it was exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring, and those things that have happened for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt in Egypt -- the headquarters for the biggest police police in San Francisco, and during the <unk> of the building, they found many <unk>
In those papers I was this <unk> called <unk> <unk>
And within that session, there were notes from a company called <unk> in Germany who had sold the military military tools to intercept the tools of the entire country.
They had this tool for <unk> <unk> the U.S. government, <unk> <unk>
The company is right here.
I mean, governments like Muslim governments provide tools for governments to do this to their citizens.
But global governments are also doing this to us.
For example, in Germany, it's just a couple of weeks ago I found <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> by the federal government, to investigate their own citizens.
If you are <unk> in a criminal case -- well, it's quite obvious that your phone is <unk>
But today it's more there.
It was <unk> the connection to the Internet.
So we even use tools like <unk> <unk> to create our computer with a <unk> to make all the communication, and listen to the arguments online, to get our data, to get our data on.
So when we think about things like these the obvious answer should be like, "Well, it seems wrong, but it's actually not true because I'm a citizen of <unk>
why do we <unk>
I don't have anything that <unk> <unk>
And that argument doesn't have any sense.
It's going to play the <unk>
<unk> is not <unk>
It's not a matter of privacy for sexual illness.
This is the freedom against the <unk>
If we could rely on our governments today in 2011, any right to <unk> today, it will be for a long time.
They were willing to pay attention to any government in the future that we could have within 50 years.
These are the questions that we should be worried about in the next 50 years.
Here is where you live in Kenya, in Kenya, in Kenya, in New York.
These are the cows of my dad at the bottom, and behind the <unk> the <unk> National <unk>
The National National Cancer Foundation is not <unk> in the most part of the South, which means that human animals like the <unk>
And you like the <unk> the <unk> and this is what they do.
<unk> our <unk>
This is one of the ones that killed the night, and as soon as we came up in the morning and we found dead me very bad because it was the only <unk>
My community, the <unk> we believe that we came out of the sky, with our animals and all the land for <unk> and so we needed to change it.
So I grew up <unk> a lot of <unk>
Now, the ones are the ones that protect our community and the <unk> and they're also happy with the problem.
So they put the <unk>
This is one of the six lions lions that killed in <unk>
I think that's why there are so few in the National Institute of <unk>
A child in my community, of six to nine years ago, is responsible for his father and this was the same thing I would end up with me.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first idea was to use paper, because I thought that the lions gave them <unk>
But I realized that in fact, this is not <unk> because even of the lions to look at lions and <unk>
I don't know.
A second idea was to use a <unk>
I was interested in lions and lions so that he was near the <unk>
But the lions are very <unk>  came the first day and saw the <unk> and the second day, and the second day, they came and said, this thing is always here.  So the lions are always here.
So one night I was walking around the hotel with a <unk> and that day the lions are not <unk>
I found that lions are afraid to be afraid to light the light <unk>
So I had a idea.
And I got a switch with which you could turn out and turn the light into the air.
And this is a little bit of a little <unk>
<unk>
So as you can see, the solar panel is a battery and a battery -- the electricity in the small box, and I call it a <unk>
And the <unk> box makes the lights <unk>
So as you can see, the <unk> they give out of it, because of course they come out of the <unk>
And so it's like you see the lions when they come out of night.
The <unk> and <unk> and <unk> to the lions and the lions to think about the <unk> but I'm going to go on my head.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
So I went on my house two years ago, and since then, we never went to have problems with the <unk>
And the houses in the neighborhood know the idea.
One of them is this <unk>
And she had killed many animals, the lions and she asked me if I could put the lights.
I told him what he did.
And you can see the <unk> you can see the lights so you can see the lights for you.
Since then, I've taken them in seven houses in my community and they're raising a lot of money.
And my point also is being used now by all Kenya, and the <unk> of other predators like <unk> <unk> and it's also using <unk> <unk>
Thanks to this <unk> I had the fortune to get a grant in one of the best schools of Kenya -- and I'm very happy to get a <unk>
My new school now is helping to raise money and <unk>
And I even took my friends to my community and built lights in the houses that I didn't know -- and I asked them how to <unk>
So a year ago, it was only a child in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> the cows of my father, and I used to see the fly, and he told me that one day I would be within it.
And here I'm here.
I took the opportunity to come back for the first time at TED.
My big dream is to be an engineer, and a pilot when I went to <unk> when I was born.
It used to be <unk> but now as my invention is saving the cows of my dad and the <unk> we can be with lions without any <unk>
<unk> <unk> What in my language means, a lot of thank you.
Chris Anderson: You don't think about the exciting thing that is to listen a story like this.
So you get a <unk> Richard <unk> Yes. Yes.
CA: You're working in other people's minds.
What's the next thing in your life?
So my next invention is -- I want to do a quick video about it. One about <unk>
<unk> I know that you have been invented by the <unk> but I want to make my daughter <unk>
CA: You know, once --        I've been trying before, but I got a <unk>  CA: When I got a <unk>  CA: On the side of the middle, Richard <unk> you're a little big <unk>
We're going to <unk> in every single step that I <unk> my friend my mother.
Many <unk> Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
When it was small, I thought that my country was the best of the planet Earth.
And I grew up writing a song called <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I felt very interesting.
In school, we get all the time studying the story of Kim <unk> but we never learned a lot of the rest of the world, except that United States South Korea, Japan is <unk>
Even while I was asking about the rest of the world, I thought that it was all my life in North Korea until all of the <unk>
And when I was seven years old, I saw my first public school.
But I thought that my life in North Korea was normal but I thought my life in North Korea was <unk>
My family was not poor and I had never spent a long time ago.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my family.
And he said, "When you do this, the five members of the family are going to exist in this world, because we haven't got it in the two weeks before.
We are <unk> together on the ground, and our bodies are so small, we are ready for <unk>
I was very <unk>
It was the first time that people were suffering in my country.
At the time, when I walked in front of the train, I saw a terrible thing that I can't imagine from my visual awareness.
A woman without life in the street, holding a child in his arms looking at their own face of his mother without being able to do anything.
No <unk> because they were very concerned about protecting themselves and their <unk>
A huge <unk> in North Korea in the North Pole.
In the end, more than a million <unk> died during <unk> and just a few years ago in the insects and <unk>
They also did more and more <unk> the <unk> of energy, all my way around the night except by the lights from the sea lights in China, just down the river from my home.
I always asked me why they had light and us not.
This is a picture of North Korea at night near the United States.
This is the <unk> Islands that serves between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain directions, allowing them to go back to the <unk>
But a lot of you know.
Sometimes, I see bodies floating in the river, in the river, by <unk>
I can't tell the details of how I came out of North Korea, but I can only say that during the years of <unk> I was sent to China to live with <unk> <unk>
But I just thought that I would be separated from my very short time.
I would never have imagined that I took 14 years to live in different places.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family without my family family.
And I had no idea how it would be life as <unk>
But I soon learned that it's not just extremely difficult, but it also dangerous, because the refugees in China were <unk> <unk>
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a great fate of the United States.
A <unk> my worst nightmare was actually when I went back to the Chinese police and asked me in the middle of the police station, and <unk>
Someone asked me to be <unk> so I would take my skills in the Chinese language, and did a lot of questions.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to be.
If it wasn't natural selection, it could be <unk> and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end up here.
But I had to control my emotions and ask questions.
At the end of the <unk> one official said to another, "This was a wonderful report -- she's not <unk>
And he left me and he was a <unk>
Some <unk> in China looking at the <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk>
But many people can be arrested by the Chinese police and <unk>
These women had a lot of luck.
Although they were <unk> they were eventually released after a very low pressure pressure on the bottom of a wall.
These <unk> don't have so much attention.
Every year, <unk> <unk> are taken in China and <unk> South Korea in the North East where they're <unk> <unk> <unk>
Even though I was fortunate to pay a lot of other girls, they haven't had so much attention.
It's a tragic thing that the <unk> have to hide their identities and fight so hard to make it so hard to survive.
Even after to learn a new language, and find all their world can be <unk> in a way.
This is why after 10 years to hide my identity, I've decided to go back to South Korea in South Africa.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> in South Korea was a much greater challenge than <unk>
The English was very important in South Korea, I had to start to learn my third thing.
I also understood that there was a huge gap between North and South Africa.
We are all <unk> but in the inside, we've come to be very different because of <unk> years of <unk>
And even after a <unk> crisis in <unk>
I'm a <unk> or <unk> or <unk> or <unk>
So where do you <unk>
And suddenly there was no country that I could call my mother.
Even though we go back to life in South Korea, it wasn't easy, I did a <unk> I started to study for the <unk>
So when I started to go back to my new life, I got a call to the <unk>
The West the North Korea of North Korea <unk> some of the money I sent my family, and as my family was going to be <unk> my family was going to be <unk>
They had to go back to the <unk>
And so I started thinking about how to fix it.
The <unk> you have to travel long distances in the way to your life.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea, and South Korea, South Korea, and South Korea, and South Korea, and South Korea, and South Korea, and South Korea, and South Korea, and South Korea, and South Korea, and South Korea, and South Korea, and South Korea, and South Korea, and South Korea, and South Korea, and South Korea, and South Korea, and South Korea, and
So ironically, ironically, I took a flight to China and put me into the border with North Korea in New York City.
Because my family couldn't talk to Chinese I had to get out in some way, for more than three thousand miles across China and then through China from South Africa.
So the journey in <unk> took a week, and we almost went out and raised several times.
One time, our bus was arrested and treated by a police officer in a <unk> official <unk>
He had to make sure that he started to ask questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese Chinese I thought that my family was going to be <unk>
When the Chinese official asked my family, I sat down and told me that they were people who were <unk> who was <unk>
And I looked at me, but I took me <unk>
We did all the way to the border of <unk>
But I had to spend almost all my money to send them to the emergency rooms in <unk>
But even after going to go back to the border, my family went back and forth, and I went to cross the border of California.
After <unk> <unk> and my family was inspired by a month, in a month, in a year.
But at the time, my family went back and raised again in the capital of <unk>
This was one of the most stable points in my life.
I did all of my family, and we were so close to them, but my family was <unk> in prison at a small distance of the United States.
And I was going to come up with the office office and the police station, desperately trying to free my family, to try to liberate my family from my family, desperately trying to liberate my family, loved my family.
But I didn't have enough money to pay more taxes or <unk>
I wanted to do it.
In that moment, or the voice of a man who knows what the hell is the <unk>
And I was so impressed that one person would love it.
With my poor English, and with a dictionary, I told him the situation, and without <unk> the man was the guy who was at the <unk> <unk> and gave me the rest of the money for my family and you would get out of it.
And I asked him with all my heart and I asked him what I would do with me.
I don't know I'm going to give you a <unk>
"I'm going to help the village <unk>
I realized that that was a real moment in my life.
The <unk> <unk> a new hope for me and for the <unk> village when more than <unk>
And I showed me that the <unk> and the support of the international community are actually the <unk> of hope that the village <unk>
With the time, after our long trip, my family and I met in South Korea, the South Pole.
But having their freedom is just half of the <unk>
Many of them are surrounded from their families and when they get to a new country, they start with a little bit of money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, practices of the physical language, and more.
We can also act as bridge between people in North Korea and the rest of the world, and the rest of the world.
Because so many of us continue in contact with family planning and we put information and money that is helping to change South Korea from the North Pole.
I've been very <unk> I've got a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help you go back a chance to <unk> an opportunity to <unk>
I'm sure you're going to see more and more <unk> <unk> around the world, including at the TED stage at the TED stage.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
I live in New York City.
This is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
So the planners of the city came together and said, we're going to change the name of New York City, so that it becomes something more, so it makes it a little bit more, so it changed the South Pole.
This is Los Angeles --  -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the end of the <unk> millions of other Americans, I live in a food desert desert in New York City Center in New York City, from the <unk> of <unk>
And the curious thing is that the places of food to take more people than the food in the car, in the <unk>
People are dying of <unk> <unk> in Los Angeles Center in New York.
For example, the rate of obesity in my neighborhood is five times higher than I say, <unk> <unk> <unk> which is like 15 miles away.
And I asked them to see that this <unk>
And I ask me how to do that, if you don't have access to healthy food, and if you go out of the house you see the <unk> effects that the survival system has in its <unk>
I saw pictures of <unk> and they would be like this.
I found out of <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk>
And I think that it should be <unk>
I think the problem is the problem.
The food is the problem, and it's the problem.
In addition to taking 45 minutes of connection, and in order to buy an apple that doesn't have any <unk>
What I did, was to plant a food forest in my home.
In a <unk> of earth that we call a <unk>
It's about 45 minutes.
The point is, who makes the city.
But you have to do it.
I said, "Well, I can do what to do, because it is my responsibility and I have to go <unk>
So it was as a <unk>
So my group and I, Sierra Leone. We put us together and started to plant our food forest forest -- you know, the nine <unk>
What we do, we are a kind of group of group paid for the <unk> of all the <unk> of all the <unk> of all the city and completely <unk> and all the ones that we do is <unk>
And the <unk> was pretty interesting.
Then someone gets <unk>
And the city gets me up and in a way, and they gave me a <unk> saying that I had to go to my <unk> <unk>
And I told me that I was going to talk about it."
A police order for building food on a piece of land that nobody ever <unk>  So I was like, "Well, <unk> <unk>
Because this time I was not going to do it.
New York had the story written by Steve <unk> and I talked to the <unk> and one of the members of <unk> <unk> who put a petition in <unk> with a <unk>
We had the dictator in our hands.
My <unk> even called to say that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, we go, why not?
L.A. is the city of the United States with more <unk>
It's got <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
That is about 20 <unk> <unk>
That's a space space, enough to plant <unk> millions of <unk>
Why the hell don't you look at the <unk>
And then a plant will take a few hundred years.
When a dollar of <unk> I'll give you two dollars a day.
This is my <unk> when I say to people that your own food.
<unk> your own food is like to print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for <unk>
I grew up there with my children there.
I would say to be part of this reality that was <unk> for me, and I'm going to make my own reality.
You see, I'm a <unk>
<unk> is my <unk> I love my art.
Perhaps like a <unk> artist who <unk> walls, I would be <unk> <unk> <unk>
I use the ground, as a piece of glass, and the plants and trees, are my <unk> of that <unk>
So you would be able to see what the earth can do, if you leave it if you leave it with your <unk>
You just can't imagine the amazing thing that it is a <unk> and how it affects the people.
What do we do?
I'm a witness of how my room became a tool for education, of my neighborhood.
In order to change the community, you have to change the Earth's atmosphere.
We are right.
So you would be able to see how it comes to <unk>
<unk> is the fastest act of <unk> and <unk> that can do, especially in a <unk>
In addition to <unk>
I remember one of the time that came a mother and her daughter, were like the <unk> of the night and were in my room, and it was very <unk>
I, you know, man, I sat down, I sat down, and I said, you know, they don't have to do this as well.
This is in the street for a reason.
I felt shame to see people that I was so close to myself, and this is just why I do this, people ask me what I do -- <unk> don't tell people that people will get your <unk>
So what I say, "For God no, I don't believe that you go to <unk>
So for that is in the street.
That's what it is.
I want you to reconstruct it, but at the same time, I want you to take your <unk>
There was another time that I put a line in a shop for <unk> in the middle of the <unk>
They were these guys, which helped me download the <unk>
It was me, I gave them their stories about how this had affected and how they used to plant prison with his mom and his grandmother, and he was <unk> to see how this stuff works.
So here <unk> has come to plant perhaps 20 <unk>
We've had like about 50 people who were working and <unk> all of them in a way.
If the kids are <unk> the kids are <unk>
If you look at <unk>
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing in which they're going to look at some color in this path designed for them, which is not the leads to.
With <unk> I see an opportunity in which we can train these kids who are <unk> from their communities to have a healthy life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe you get the next George <unk> <unk>
But if we don't change the composition of the land, it never is.
Now this is one of my favorites. This is something that I want to do.
I want to show you a single block of clay, where people can share food in the same way.
I want to take <unk> and combine them in <unk>
I don't know.
I'm not talking about things free, because the bad news is not enough.
The curious thing about sustainability is that you have to <unk>
So what I'm talking about is to put people back to the people, take the kids out of the street, who know the fear and freedom and honor to grow their own food, by opening their own food, by opening up their own food.
What I want to do here, we have to make it better?
I want everybody to become <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We have to change the <unk> of what's a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
That <unk> you can take your <unk>
And that is his <unk> <unk>
In <unk> if you want to get me to me, you know, if you want to go back and say, if you want to sit on chairs and have meetings to talk about doing some <unk> to talk about doing some <unk>
If you want to go to the front with your <unk> so that we can plant something.
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
<unk> <unk>   <unk> <unk>  You probably will have to remember me in which this is a very powerful road to <unk>
It's made of <unk> and <unk> is a good material to fly, but not always, especially in days like today, where it rains, a lot.
You can have a huge amount of water in the <unk> that <unk> <unk>
And especially if you go out in your bicycle and these cars -- that it's not very interesting.
In addition, the <unk> can make a lot of money.
This is a complicated material and if we build out the size of the Netherlands -- very close to cities, we want a road to <unk>
The solution for that is to make <unk> <unk>
The <unk> <unk> a material that we use now in the majority of the United States -- has <unk> and water can go through it, so all the rain water flow towards the bottom, and you have a road that is easy to fly, and you have a road that is easy to fly, and you don't get it.
The noise also disappear in these <unk>
Because it's very cold, all of the noise -- so it is a very different piece of paper.
It also has a <unk> of course, and the bottom of this road is that you can <unk>
What is <unk> You see that in this piece the stones in the surface are <unk>
First of all, a little bit more and more and more and more and more and more <unk> and <unk> --  But you can lose your <unk> and you might be happy with it.
And finally, this can also take more and more <unk>
Sometimes they can create <unk>
Thank you very much.
<unk> of course, that you can convert into a problem, but we have a problem.
Here you can see what the damage is in this <unk>
This is a <unk> <unk> as I said, so only you have a little bit of <unk> between the whales and the <unk>
Because of the <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> this <unk> this <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> and if you go to <unk> it will be <unk> and <unk>
So if you go through the road, you can see the <unk> as we saw here.
To solve this problem, we think of this problem, and we think of this problem.
If we can make this material <unk> then we probably have a problem.
So what we can do is to use plastic wood from that to clean <unk> and we can put the shadow of steel in bits of small bits and we can put those little bits with the <unk>
So we have <unk> with small pieces of wood on it.
And then you need a machine, like what you see here, that you use to get a machine from the <unk>
So the <unk> can exist, especially <unk> it's very good at that.
So what you have to do is clean the steel <unk> the <unk> the <unk> and the stones and the stones and the stones and the stones and the stones and the stones and the stones and the stones on the floor.
So today I used a <unk> because I can't bring the big machine to the <unk> here to the <unk>
The <unk> <unk> is a <unk> system.
I put the sample, I'm going to take you to see what it looks like.
This is what it looks right now.
I said that we have this kind of industrial machine in the laboratory to heat them up.
We took a lot of samples out there and then government, and then the government, really saw our results and said, "Well, that's very interesting.
So we took a piece of paper, 400 meters of the <unk> <unk> where we had to make an trial for trial to test this <unk>
So that was what we did here, you see where we were doing the test online, and then, of course, this road started several years without any <unk> That's what we know from the <unk>
We took a lot of samples from this road and we tested them in the lab, and we tested them in the lab.
We did all the way, we put a lot of burden on them, and the <unk> then the <unk> then the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk>
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can say that we've made a material using steel using these fibers, using the energy energy -- to actually increase the life of the surface of the road, even you can double the life of the surface of the surface.
And now, of course, you know, of course, you have how to do this as well.
We still have the show here. It's pretty interesting.
Actually, you have to cut first before I can show you how it acts as it is being <unk>
But I'm going to make a look at a <unk>
Let's look at this.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
When I was 11 years old, I remember -- I remember <unk> one morning with the sound of <unk> in my home.
My father was listening to me in his small radio radio and <unk>
He had a great smile in his face that was unusual in those times, because the news is usually <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my dad.
I didn't know what to do, but I could see that my father was very, very happy to see that my father was very, very happy.
"Now I know you can go to a <unk>
One morning that I never got to <unk>
A high school school school school.
You see, I had six years ago when the Taliban were six years ago when the Taliban found out of Afghanistan and sold girls to school.
So for the next five years, I would argue, as a child in my own sister that I couldn't be used to be used to go to a <unk>
It was the only way that the two could <unk>
Every day, a different route that nobody could be able to get out of where you <unk>
We had to hide the books in a market so that we were going out of it.
The school was at a home and more than 100 percent of them raised in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely <unk> it was extremely <unk>
We all know that <unk> our <unk> the students and our friends and our kids.
Again, the school would go back to a week, because the Taliban <unk> <unk> <unk>
We always asked ourselves what they knew about it.
They were <unk>
Did you know where you <unk>
We were <unk> but even so, the school was where we wanted to be a <unk>
I was very successful in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters were <unk> and the daughters were <unk>
My grandfather was a remarkable man for her time.
A total of a total <unk> of <unk> <unk> in which his daughter, my mother went to school and said, her father would be <unk>
But my mother would go back to the <unk>
This is it. This is it.
It was made two years ago, only to convert our house in school for girls and women in our neighborhood.
And my father, this is, he was the first of his family in getting education, for education, and my family to get education.
There was no doubt that their children had to get education, even their daughters, even their daughters, despite the <unk> despite the <unk>
For him, there were a higher risk of their kids.
For the years of the <unk> I remember that there were times in which I was very frustrated about our life and I was always scared and I didn't see a future.
I wanted to, but my father said, <unk> <unk> <unk> you can lose everything you have in life.
You can pay your money. You can buy your money. You can take your house for a war.
But there is one thing that will always be you, which is here and if we have to sell our blood pressure to pay your education, it does it.
So you even want to be <unk>
Today, I have 22 years now.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed for decades of war.
Less than six percent of the women of my age have more than <unk> and if my family didn't have been so successful with my education, I would be one of the <unk>
Instead, I find myself proud of myself in <unk>
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, which was <unk> of her home for the courage to educate his daughters, was one of the first in <unk>
He's not only <unk> of my wife, but also that I was the first woman, and I am the first woman, which I'm going to driving through the streets of <unk>
My family believes in me.
And I dream in big, but my family has even more dreams for <unk> dreams for <unk>
This is why I'm so <unk> <unk> a global campaign to educate women women.
This is why <unk> <unk> the first and perhaps private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country in Afghanistan, a country in Afghanistan, a country in the United States.
So the exciting thing is that I see students in my high school with a strong opportunity.
And I look at her parents and their families who, like the <unk> <unk> for them, even though and even in front of a <unk>
Like <unk> not his name, and I can't show you their face, but Rick is the father of one of my students.
About a month, he and his daughter went back to her village, and literally, he was killed by being killed by a <unk> in the way, for minutes in the middle, for minutes.
When they get to her home, they are the phone, a voice would tell you that if I kept sending her daughter to school, they would go to the <unk>
<unk> now, if you <unk> -- if you <unk> I would be able to buy the future of my old daughter and <unk>
And what I've been finding from Afghanistan, and it's something that is often forgotten in the West, is that behind the majority of the majority of the people who <unk> there is a father who recognized the value of his own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers haven't been key in our success.
In fact, they are often the first <unk> of the brilliant future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of people.
Under <unk> the girls who were going to school in <unk> remember, it was possible."
But today, more than three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan is so different from here in the United States.
I find the Americans see the <unk> of the <unk>
And so these changes are not <unk> so much, after of the U.S. troops in the United States.
But when I went back to Afghanistan, when I see students in my school and their parents who <unk> for them, I see the <unk> I see a future of <unk>
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities for each other, and every day the girls of <unk>
And as I, they would be in high school.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
I have never forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
But I never would never be able to make you a <unk>
You've spent almost two years since the last two years since the <unk> revolution inspired by the <unk> of <unk> <unk> as the <unk> <unk>
A forces with many other citizens -- within and out of the country to call a day of <unk> and start a revolution against the regime of <unk>
And the <unk> was a great <unk>
Women and men and young men were in the <unk> <unk> the every single <unk>
You have shown a way to deal with the <unk> <unk> <unk>
You have shown a huge sense of atrazine, from the <unk> of <unk> to the west coast to the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of war and a few of about 50 feet, we were able to liberate our country and <unk> the <unk>
However, <unk> left a <unk> <unk> of <unk> corruption and seeds from <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For four decades, the regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure, and the moral structure, the moral structure of society.
<unk> of the devastation and the challenges, the challenges, along with many other women, rebuild civil society -- a <unk> society -- and just towards democracy, and the high seas of the <unk>
So a few years about 200 organizations in <unk> and immediately after the every <unk> <unk> 300 in <unk>
And after a period of a period of <unk> I went back to London, and with a wonderful experience I started to organize over the developing world.
With a very incredible group of women we founded the <unk> of Women <unk> by <unk> a movement of women, and of <unk> <unk> <unk> to advocate for the <unk> <unk> of the woman and the <unk> of the democracy and the <unk>
I found myself with a very hard environment in the period -- a environment that was increasingly <unk> than <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
With the time, our initiative was taken and successful and successful organizations.
Women won a <unk> of the National Congress in the early elections in 52 years.
However, a little bit, the <unk> of elections and the revolution were as a everything, they were <unk> all the days of violence.
One day we went back to the news of the <unk> of ancient Muslim and <unk> <unk>
Another day <unk> with the murder of the murder of the murder of American American and the <unk>
The other day we arrived with the murder of the murder of the <unk> of <unk>
And every day, every day we went back to the government of <unk> and their <unk> freedom of human rights from the prisoners and their lack of respect of <unk>
Our society, we made for a <unk> <unk> and it has been away from the ideals and the principles of sexual justice, that we had the beginning.
The <unk> the <unk> and the <unk> became the ones of the <unk> of the <unk>
I'm not here today to take you with the success of the success of the <unk> <unk> and the <unk>
More long now, I'm here today to tell you that we, as a nation, you know, we take the wrong decision -- we take the wrong decision, we take the wrong decision right now.
I don't know.
Because the choices we were not only the peace, the stability and security and security to others.
The list of <unk> and the <unk> between Saudi Arabia, and <unk> became peace and <unk>
No, we didn't do it.
What does it do?
Why our society continues to be <unk> and we need to connect with <unk> <unk> and <unk> so for men like <unk>
Perhaps what happened were not only women, but the women of compassion, <unk> and <unk>
Our society needs the national dialogue and creation of consensus more than the election that only <unk> the polarization and <unk>
Our nation needs <unk> <unk> which is more than we need to need <unk> <unk> and <unk> of it.
We need to leave to act as agents of abuse, and I'll call days of <unk>
We need to start to act as agents of compassion and <unk>
We have to develop a <unk> <unk> which is not only <unk> but also to put the <unk> instead of the <unk> in the middle of the <unk> <unk> the <unk> in the <unk>
So these are the ideals that we do with the war, we need desperately to end up the end of the iceberg.
Because peace has a <unk> which is about the <unk> and the <unk> between the traditional perspectives and the <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to build the best way before we make it <unk>
According to a <unk> of the Koran <unk> <unk> the word of God <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the same time, the word <unk> which is known in all the traditions, <unk> has the same root in Arabic that the word <unk> <unk> and <unk> the humanity of the humanity that men and women are and women have <unk>
And so as much as the <unk> covers the <unk> that grows inside the compassion of compassion and all the <unk>
So he says, "I'm going to go back all the <unk> all the <unk>
So he says, "I'm going to go back to my <unk>
That all of them are going to make them <unk>
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
I'm here today to tell you about a positive question, which has an equally <unk> idea.
This is the secrets of the <unk> and the question that I'm going to deal with is what you all do, why you all know why you are all <unk>
Why was someone going to stay with a man who was <unk>
I am not a <unk> or a social <unk> or not an expert in violence, not about <unk>
I'm just a woman with a story with a story that <unk>
He was 22 years old, at the University of 2004.
I had moved to New York for my first work as a writer and an editor at <unk>
And I was my first apartment, my first <unk> <unk> <unk> and I had a very big secret to <unk>
My secret was that many, many times, the man, who I creates my soul <unk> I would go back to the head with a <unk>
The man who loved anyone in this world, put a <unk> in my head and said, <unk> more times than I can ever be in my head of the <unk>
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- where you get every year for every year of women, and even a few hundred people.
It could be his story.
And I didn't have a typical <unk> of <unk>
I'm a <unk> in English at Harvard University, and I have a <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>
I've spent the biggest part of my career working for companies from the list of the <unk> <unk> between them called <unk> <unk> <unk> and The <unk> <unk>
I spent almost 20 years ago with my second husband and we have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and <unk> a <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can go to anyone, all of them -- all of them -- all of them -- all the <unk> and education levels and education.
It's all for all of you.
And my second message is that all of us think that violence violence happens to women, which is a problem of women.
I don't know.
Over about 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and sexual abuse, only happens in relationships -- <unk> <unk> or, as long as we think about another way, the last place where we believe or we would find out <unk> which means <unk>
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world who would be with a man who was <unk> and I was a very typical victim because of my age.
And I was 22 years old, and in the United States women in the United States and 24 years ago have three times more than being victims of being victims of being victims of civil war than the other women and girls in that age are <unk> every single day is <unk>
I also went a typical victim because I didn't know anything about violence violence, your <unk> or your <unk>
I met <unk> in a cold, and it was going to be a little bit <unk>
I was sitting on my side of New York City and started to <unk> me to <unk>
He told me two things.
The first was that he was also a <unk> from a college of <unk> <unk> and I was working on a very important bank of the <unk>
But what I was most impressed in that first encounter was that it was ready and fun, and that it seemed a little bit <unk>
It had a lot of big <unk> like that, and a little <unk> and it seemed so <unk>
One of the most smart things that did <unk> from the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of <unk>
He did it about all of the beginning of a <unk>
We started to go back and loved all of it, which was ready to go to Harvard, I would make passion to help girls <unk> and my work.
I wanted to know all about my family, my dreams and my friends.
<unk> creates me in me, as a writer and as a woman, as nobody had done before.
And it was so that the <unk> in that <unk> school and the work on Wall Street and their brilliant future had so much importance for him.
And I didn't know that the first phase of violence is <unk> and <unk> and <unk> to the <unk>
And I didn't know that the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was I went from New York and leave the work of my dreams, but I thought I had to make sure that I had to make sure that I was going to go back my work and put them together with the <unk>
I had no idea that I was growing up in a <unk> <unk> which was going back into a physical perspective, and very carefully <unk> <unk>
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to put the threat of violence to see how it works.
And here is where you go in the scene of those <unk>
So what we moved to New York -- you know, that site where it was supposed to be so sure that I bought three <unk>
One was in the <unk> of the <unk>
And another guy under the pillow in our bed, and the third always in his head.
And he said that I needed to go to the <unk> that lived in the <unk>
I needed to make sure I needed to feel secure.
But those <unk> were actually a message for me, and, although I had never been diagnosed with my hand, my life was already in serious <unk> every minute of every day.
The first <unk> heart attack happened five days before we got five days before our <unk>
They were seven o'clock in the morning and I still had <unk> <unk> <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 <unk> of my neck had been taken me from my mother and married me with him.
Even though there were no <unk> I was sure I would be happy to be happy for me, because I loved it, and he also wanted to be a <unk>
And he was very, very <unk>
There was just a lot of <unk> for the wedding, and by the fact of creating a family with me.
It had been an accident that I would never be able to put on the <unk>
And I spent two times in our <unk> <unk>
And the first time I was driving to a secret and <unk> and he gave me so strong in the head that <unk> several times against the <unk>
And then a couple of days later, driving out of our <unk> <unk> <unk> and I put me up on a Big Bang, and I put it up on the floor.
<unk> he took me one or two times a week for the next two years and a half of our <unk>
I <unk> when I thought it was the only thing in this room.
One of three women is the victim of domestic violence or <unk> at some time of their life, and the Department of Capricorn -- that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 years old.
So actually, I had a very good company.
Going back to my question: why do I <unk>
The answer is yes.
I didn't know that he was <unk>
Now, I was a very strong woman who was a very strong woman who was deeply <unk> and it was the only person in the world that I could help <unk>
The other question that everybody does is why simply not just <unk>
Why don't I do that? I could have been at any time.
So for me, this is the best question that people do, because we are the <unk> we know something that normally you can normally <unk> it's incredibly dangerous to a <unk>
Because the last phase in the pattern of domestic violence is <unk>
Over the 70 percent of <unk> in cases of domestic violence -- after the victim has given the relationship, after <unk> because then the <unk> has nothing to do.
Other states include the <unk> even after the <unk> even after the <unk> has become <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the victim and their children, who are usually forced by the judges to spend time on the man who <unk>
And even so we continue to ask why it simply doesn't look like.
I was able to go back to the end of a last <unk> to get my <unk>
I realized that the man who loved me would have won if he would have <unk>
So I was so <unk>
And he told everybody to all the world: the police to my friends, and family friends and family friends and I am here today because all of you are born.
We have the trend to <unk> the victims as headlines like headlines like headlines <unk>
The question, "Why are you <unk>
So for some people is a way of saying "The lack of disgust is not by <unk> as if the victims of <unk> were <unk> of men who want to <unk>
But since I had <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who are also <unk> who learned that a lesson, of what happened and that they would take their lives and happy, like <unk> wives and happy lives and happy lives.
Because it turns out that I am a victim and a lawyer and a member of <unk> <unk>
And I went to sleep with a man and she said, and we have those three children.
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
What I didn't go back to have never ever more, I was a <unk> <unk> on my head in the hands of someone who says to me.
In this moment, like this, like this, that is <unk> or <unk> or <unk> which <unk> but all this time I actually have been talking about you.
I promise you there are a few people people who are listening right now, which are being <unk> or that they were being <unk> or that they were <unk> or they were <unk>
The <unk> could be affecting his daughter, and her sister to his best friend at the same time.
I was able to put my crazy crazy love to be able to get the <unk>
And I have to do that.
This is my way to help other victims, and this is my last petition to you to see you in your last talk.
Remember, what you've heard here.
<unk> <unk> only in <unk>
They have the power to end up with local violence by simply putting light on it.
The victims we need to do all the world.
We need that every one of you to understand the secrets of violence.
Look at the <unk> of light talking about it with your kids, your colleagues at work, their friends and their friends.
<unk> his view of survivors as well as young people and <unk> who have a <unk> future.
And I would like the signs of violence to be able to get to stop it, and to show the victims of the victims of the <unk>
Together, we can convert our jobs up our tables and our families in the <unk> and we need to be.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Hello. I call <unk> <unk> and from a time, I'm going to take a <unk>
To be about 10 years ago.
And I feel that at this moment, there's a real tension in the room because I don't have <unk> --                          Thank you.
This is the first piece of clothes on a stage of <unk> so you have a lot of a lot of <unk>
If some of the women are <unk> when they <unk> they don't have to <unk> now, but what to figure out later on Twitter on Twitter on Twitter, but what would it later on Twitter for me?
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think about myself as just 10 <unk>
<s> not all the world has that opportunity.
These <unk> are very <unk> less bad than I don't have to do it.
The worst part is going to move this button on your head, because it is when you're going to go to me, so you don't do anything as well.
Very good.
Why have we done this?
It's been <unk>
Well, I hope it's not as much as this picture of this picture.
The appearance is powerful, but also <unk>
I changed totally what I thought about myself in six <unk> in six <unk>
And in this picture, I had never had a boyfriend in real life.
I was totally <unk> and the photographer told me that I would take the back and put him up on the floor.
And of course, except with surgery or an artificial <unk> like that I did two days for work, there are very little things that we can do to transform our self, which, although the places and <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, for me, will be <unk> means to be <unk>
I'm in this stage because I am model, because I'm this model, because I'm <unk>
Because I'm a nice woman and white and in my private sector that is being a young girl, <unk>
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but in a <unk> way.
The first question is, how is it going to be <unk>
And I always say, a <unk> I would say that it doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I made this model is because it won the genetics, and I'm the <unk> of a <unk> and maybe you are asking what this means.
Well, in the last centuries not only have the beauty as health, youth and symmetry, which we are biologically able to pay for <unk> we also have that we've been growing up to a high and <unk> skin on the <unk>
And that's my <unk> <unk> that I've known to make money.
And I know there are people in the audience who are now <unk> and perhaps a few of them who <unk> <unk> <unk> -- they're <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
First of all, the <unk> to know so much of the <unk> is quite incredible.
But I have to tell you that in 2007, a graduate student from the University of New York told all and every one of the models in the <unk> and of the <unk> models, only <unk> is just <unk>
So the next question that people always do is to be able to be a model when it comes to <unk>
And my first answer is, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know that.
But also, what I really would say to each of these girls is why you can be what you want.
You can be the president of the United States or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a lawyer and a <unk> <unk> which is what it would be, because it would be <unk>
If after this list is still <unk> No, yes, I want to be model, then I say, I know my <unk>
Because I'm not in charge of nothing, and you could be the head of <unk> <unk> American magazine or the middle of <unk> or the next Steven <unk>
To say that most of the biggest you want to be model is as to say that you want to win the <unk>
It's out of your control, it's amazing, and it's not a work that you can imagine.
I'm going to show you what I learned in 10 years as a model, because unlike surgery surgery can be <unk> right now, right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Even once you've seen your studies, and you have a <unk> and a few jobs on your back, you don't matter what <unk> is to say, if you will, that you want to be president of the United States, but your <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> people would look at it.
The next question that people are always doing is if all the pictures are <unk>
And yes, no one of the pictures, but that's just a little part of what it looks like.
This was the first picture that I would do, and also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have my own.
I know that we're going into the personal ground but it was a <unk>
And so I went back to my grandmother a few months ago.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came to me with me with me with me.
Here I'm in a party party -- a few days before the pictures for the <unk>
Here I am with my team and in New York.
And this is me in <unk>
And I hope you realize that I'm not myself in those days.
They are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and all of their <unk> and the people and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and <unk>
Well, the next question that people always do is to make sure that they will be able to do it.
I have a lot of <unk> and I have never ever seen, except the couple before, but the <unk> that I get in the real life, and what we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and once I went to a store and I forgot to take money, and they gave me the <unk>
When I was a teenager, I was born with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and of course, we would be <unk> and <unk> a <unk> agent to be able to keep <unk>
And I would like to talk about these <unk> because of what I'm talking about. And there are people who are paying for a price for their <unk>
I live in New York City, and last year from the <unk> teenage girls who were going to go to the <unk> <unk> were black and <unk> and most of them were young men in New York City.
And there are only <unk> young black young black young black holes in New York City, so for them, not a matter of <unk>
But about how many times I would be <unk>
By looking for this talk, I found out that the 53 percent of the girls in the United States in the United States don't like their body, and that number gets to the <unk>
So the last question that people ask me is, how is the life of a <unk>
And I think the answer to you is, if you're a little more thin and you have the most brilliant hair, you feel very happy and <unk>
And behind the cameras, we give them an answer that perhaps what they do.
And it's really wonderful -- and also incredible power to work with very creative people and <unk>
And everything is true, but it's just one part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, which I never said in front of them, is <unk>
And I am because I have to worry about my story.
And if you ever say that, you know, with a smaller legs and the most brilliant hair will be more <unk>
They only have to do with a group of models, because they have the most <unk> legs and the most brilliant clothes -- but it's probably the most important women on the planet.
But most of it was hard to take a <unk> situation and help when I am one of the biggest <unk>
If there is something that would be about this talk, I hope you all feel more comfortable to recognize the power of the image in the perception that we have the success of the <unk>
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
The photograph has been my passion since I was good enough to try a camera, but I want to share with you my 15 pictures more <unk> and I didn't go to the <unk>
And there were no <unk> no <unk> no chance to give the pictures, not even a <unk> in the <unk>
In fact, the majority of the <unk> <unk>
My story begins when <unk> in the city of New York to give me a <unk> my wife gave me this picture by holding my daughter on the day of his first <unk> that is the corner of the <unk>
He had been that we went to New York just a year later, so we decided to take the same picture.
Well, you can see what comes right now.
So when I arrived at my third birthday birthday my wife told me why don't you go to New York to New York in a <unk> trip to the <unk>
So here is when we started to ask the <unk> that we were going to get up the picture that we were going to get up the picture.
This is amazing that the gesture of getting the camera to a full <unk> is so <unk>
It never has been so often, and, luckily, no one has ever been <unk> with the camera.
So we were not aware of how long it would change the life of this day.
It became a very important thing for us.
This picture is about a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day in a way that a child of five years would happen.
These pictures are much more than representations of a concrete moment or a single trip to the other.
It's also a way to stop the time in a week and try to understand the time of our time and our evolution over the years, and not only about physical level, but in all the ways.
Because, even though we always put the same picture, our perspective goes into new <unk> and I can see life through your eyes and how it does, and it interacts with it.
That time in the concrete that we spend together is something that we hope with illusion every year.
And recently, in one of the villages, we were <unk> when suddenly, it was ready to go back and put a red <unk> of the <unk> <unk> which <unk> from a small <unk>
And I told me what there was sense of five years of standing in that same way.
<unk> who had their heart <unk> with force to see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what you look at in New York are the universities, because it's determined to study in New York City.
And suddenly, I understood that one of the most important things that we created is the <unk>
So I want to share the idea of engaging in physical creation of <unk>
I don't know you, but apart from these 15 pictures, I don't get in a lot of the photographs that I have.
I am always saying that you have the picture that you take the picture to you.
Now today, I want to encourage you all to be in the picture, and you don't have to go back to someone and do it.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
I'd like to talk about a very special group of things.
There are 10 species of birds in the world.
The <unk> are in the <unk> group of <unk> <unk>
First of all, why do you have so bad <unk>
It also has also been associated with Disney -- like <unk> <unk> <unk>
More recently, if you've been looking at the press press --     and <unk> these are the attributes that are based on Parliament in Parliament -- but I don't know.
You don't know why you know what?
Because the members of Parliament don't keep <unk> the environment, and the <unk> don't help prevent the <unk> <unk>
They are <unk>   You're far from <unk>  And my favorite thing is that the <unk> are better than --  There's two types of <unk> on this planet.
There are the <unk> of the United States in the United States who are now in <unk> like <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we have 16 species.
So why are the <unk> are <unk> First of all, they provide services <unk>
They are our <unk> <unk>
And we would put them into the <unk>
They help them kill all the birds to absorb the need, which is not about them -- and they would have great loss of death and diseases in other animals.
In recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> ads are about three to four times in <unk> and this has huge <unk> in the <unk>
The <unk> also have huge <unk>
They have been associated with the former culture of <unk>
<unk> was the symbol of the <unk> and the <unk> and, along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between <unk> <unk> the unit of <unk>
In <unk> <unk> it was the god <unk> and <unk> his life to save the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In the <unk> culture, it is a very important thing to be very important -- and in places like <unk> there is no place to get out of the <unk> or wood to <unk> so that these <unk> provide a quality of violence.
What's the problem with the <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, which six of them are at the end of which six of them <unk>
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason they're being <unk> is because there are conflicts between humans and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> use this rule against food, and as a result, the <unk> are victims of this.
On the south of Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are in the critical list of <unk> which means that at least 10 or 15 years -- and the reason is because they pay for a drug for a drug or 15 years.
So this drug has been <unk> to use them in India and have taken a go.
Because there are no <unk> there has been a <unk> in the number of white dogs in <unk> and when you have dogs <unk> it has a huge <unk> <unk> for <unk> the number of cases of death has become huge <unk>
Kenya is going to have one of the biggest parks in <unk> <unk> <unk> are going to be a <unk> <unk>
I'm not against energy power, but we have to work with governments, because the gas turbines do this to the <unk> and the <unk>
They're <unk>
In sub-Saharan Africa, there are a very strong legal venture from <unk> to serve the <unk> and the <unk>
So what does it do? Well, we're exploring these little <unk> We are <unk>
We're trying to determine their basic ecology, and see where they are going.
We can see that they travel across different countries, so we focus on a problem, not going to serve about anything.
We have to work with governments at the low levels of <unk>
We're working with local communities and <unk>
We're talking with them about asking them to do the <unk> on the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that we <unk>
How can you <unk> <unk> It can become <unk> and you can write a letter to your government, and you say we need to focus on these very <unk> creatures.
When you go out of this room, you have to focus on <unk> but to talk with your families, with their families, with their neighbors on the <unk>
They are very <unk> Charles Darwin said that it changed because he saw that he saw that he saw that the energy in the <unk>
In Kenya, this world will be much more poor without these wonderful species.
Thank you. Thank you.
Every thing I do, and everything I do, my life has been <unk> for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
From <unk> to <unk> <unk> -- but I don't think   I worked in <unk> Kenya of <unk> <unk> and <unk> in <unk> projects with a technique called <unk>
I worked for a <unk> and every project that we built in Africa -- <unk> in Africa <unk>
And I was <unk>
And the <unk> that we did -- we were good people and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Instead of that, everything you would <unk>
Our first project, which I inspired my first book, <unk> <unk> was a project where a few months ago, we decided to teach people to teach people to <unk>
So we come up with seeds in the south of <unk> to this valley absolutely amazing that it comes to the <unk> <unk> and we teach them to local <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
Of course, people were not at all interested in doing that, because they were going to come to work, and some times, they were not <unk>  We were <unk>  We were <unk>  We were in the <unk>
However, instead of asking about how it was possible to be able to do it, we simply said, "Thank you for God that we're going to save people in time to save people from the <unk>
And of course, everything in Africa is <unk>
We had these <unk> <unk> in Italy, a <unk> <unk> in <unk> to this area in this country.
And we don't think we were saying that we were saying that we were saying the <unk> What is the <unk>
When the protocells were <unk> <unk> and red at night at night, about 200 <unk> came from the river and they ate everything -- and we said to them --  And we said to the <unk>
And the <unk> said, "Yes, that's why we don't have agriculture --  "Why don't we have the <unk>
I thought that we were just <unk> <unk> <unk> in Africa, but then, I saw what the Americans, what they were doing, what they were doing, what they were doing, what they were doing, and then to see what they were doing, I felt pretty proud of our project.
Because, as you see, at least we go at least feed the <unk>
And I would look at the <unk>  I would look at the <unk> -- to see the <unk> of the <unk> people of Africa.
You want to read a book, I read <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> economist <unk> <unk> economist <unk>
The book was called the <unk>
We, the Western African countries have taken the African continent two billion dollars in the last 50 years.
I don't tell you about harm than the money has <unk>
You just read his book.
It was a part of a African woman that we've done before.
The West are <unk> <unk> <unk> and we try to give people only two things: or <unk> or we are <unk> or we're <unk>
The two words come from the <unk> <unk> <unk> which means <unk> <unk>
However, it means two different things.
<unk> I try to give anyone of a different culture, like these guys, I want you to have my kids.
<unk> I try to take all of the different aspects of a different culture like this.
That's why the white in Africa are called <unk>
That book gave me a <unk> in the face of a little <unk> written by <unk> who said about all of economic development, if people don't want to be <unk>
This should be the first of the first <unk>
The first principle of aid is <unk>
So this morning, Mr. Mr. <unk> put a rock on the ground, and said, we can do that, you can imagine a city that is not <unk>
I spent the 27 years going to the people, and invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never see nothing, you never get anything in a <unk> but it becomes a <unk> of local passion -- the <unk> of local passion in a better person.
So what does it do?
I don't think it comes to a community with an idea, and I sit with people from <unk>
We don't work from the <unk>
We put them in a <unk> we met in a <unk>
We have zero <unk>
And what do we do? We become friends, and we know what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is the truth.
You can give an idea to somebody who's a <unk>
If that person doesn't want to do that, what is going to do that? What will you do?
The passion that she has for their own growth is the most important.
The passion that the man has for his own personal growth is the most important thing is most important.
And so I will help you find the emotions because nobody in the world can have success alone.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but the knowledge is available for us.
So years ago, I had this idea: why don't we, by once instead of getting to a community to tell people what to do, why no, for one time, I would be <unk> but not in <unk>
I'll tell you a secret.
There's a problem with the <unk> <unk>
The entrepreneurs never <unk> and they would never say, in a public meeting what they want to do with their own money, what to do with their own money.
So the planning has this point of view.
In the most smart people of their community, you don't even know it, because they don't look at their <unk>
What do we do? We're working on one to one, and we work face to face, you have to create a social infrastructure which doesn't exist.
You should create a new way to create a new way.
The profession is the medical doctor in the company, the medical medical doctor in the business of the business, which comes with you in your house, at the table in your kitchen, and that helps you find the resources to transform their passion in a way or life.
I started this as a test in New York City.
I was doing a Ph.D. in that time, trying to get out of this garbage <unk> where we got to tell you what to do.
In a year, I had 27 projects in march, and the government came to see to say, "How can we do that?
So how can I go? And I said, "I did something very, very hard very hard.
I'm going to tell you --             So the government says, <unk> we have done in 300 communities in the world.
We've helped to start 40 <unk>
There's a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of <unk>
Peter <unk> one of the most elegant women in history, died of <unk> a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a philosophy of philosophy before in business, and this is what says Peter <unk> "The planning is actually incompatible with a society and an economy of <unk>
The planning is the name of the death of the spirit of <unk>
So now <unk> <unk> <unk> not to know what the most <unk> people in <unk> want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to be able to get these people to get up with you with one of you with you with you.
You have to be able to make privacy, you have to be great at <unk> and then you will be able to go to <unk>
In a community of 10 people, we have 200 babies.
You can imagine a community of 400 people, intelligence and <unk> and <unk>
So what do you do, you have more than this <unk>
Young people <unk> That's what you have -- that's what you have <unk>
So what I say is that the spirit of <unk> is where it is.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution -- fossil fuels, fossil fuels -- and of a moment to another, we have systems that are not <unk>
The blood engine engine is not enough.
The <unk> as a form of <unk> is not enough.
So what we have to consider, is how to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to seven billion people, in a <unk> way.
There are no technologies to do this.
Who is going to invent technology for the <unk> revolution in the <unk>
The <unk> <unk>
You know, the entrepreneurs and they are doing what they're doing now.
There's a story that I in a <unk> magazine many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York in the year 2000.
And in the last year we found this group of people, and it would be about what would happen to the city of New York in 100 years, and the conclusion was that the city of New York was not <unk> within 100 years.
Why? Because he picks up the curve and <unk> if the population is growing up to this <unk> to bring the population of New York to <unk> <unk> six billion <unk> and the slime mold would be impossible for six billion would be impossible to see.
They were already <unk> in <unk>  So in <unk> they were <unk> this <unk> technology that <unk> the life of New York City.
So what do we do? In the next 40 years, in 1900, in America, in the United States alone, <unk> <unk> companies <unk>
So the idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very little, <unk> factories in places like <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
However, there is a secret to work with the <unk>
First, you have to go to the <unk>
In another way, I don't come up with you with you.
And then you have to take a <unk> <unk> service service service service <unk>
And <unk> you will have to tell the truth with the <unk>
The smaller company -- the fastest company has to be able to do three things -- the product that you want to sell has to be <unk> you have to tell them with a fantastic dance and you have to tell with a big <unk>
Do you know what?
We've never met a human being in the world who can do, sell and look at the money alone.
It doesn't work.
This still has no <unk>
We've looked at them and looked at the 100 companies of the world's <unk> <unk> <unk> -- all the research companies -- <unk>
There is only one thing that all the companies in the world have in common -- just an example of a single person.
But the word <unk> but the word <unk>
He was not only when they went to <unk>
No one has a company called <unk>
So we can create the community where we have <unk> who have <unk> who come from a small environment of a small environment -- in <unk> in <unk> in <unk> who are going to make sure that someone did this gentleman who talks about this <unk> someone who talks about it.
What can you do here? You can do it.
Well, what you can do is you can look at the <unk>
They said, "Oh, I can't do that." You can't do that."
We put them together and <unk>
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
We know they can help us help us improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so you don't know much better, even though of sharing the same spaces we have.
In the last few years I've tried to share more with my neighbors in public space, with simple tools like <unk> <unk> and <unk>
These projects came out of questions like, how much they pay my neighbors for their <unk>
How can we pay and ask and ask more things about the door in a bad way?
So how to share more memories of our local buildings and understand better our <unk>
How do we share more our hopes and hopes for <unk> cows so that our communities can reflect on our needs.
I live in New York -- and I'm in New York City.
My soul is always <unk> with the giants that give a shadow to <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> for centuries and I have a <unk>
I always give the music.  There is a <unk> in New York --  And the city has one of the world's most beautiful <unk> of the world, but also one with the biggest <unk>
I live near this house and I thought about how it could turn into a deeper space, and also in something that changed my life for me.
In 2009 I missed someone who loved someone who loved someone who loved a lot of a lot.
It was <unk> as a mother for <unk>
His death was sudden and he did.
I thought a lot of the death and I thought about it.
And this led me a deep feeling for time lived and over and this happened.
He gave him the most significant things of my life.
But I would be able to keep this back in my life.
It seems to me that it's easy to catch up the day to day and forget the important thing for you.
So with the help of old and new friends opened the wall of this abandoned house in a giant giant <unk> and I painted them on a giant <unk> <unk> <unk>
So the <unk> could take a <unk> understanding of their lives and share social relationships in public space.
I didn't know what this experiment was, but the next day the wall was filled and followed by <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote in the air, and I would like to share the <unk>
Before they died I want to be <unk>   Before I died I want to sit in the line of <unk> in the <unk>
Before they died I want to sing for millions of years.
Before they died I want to plant a <unk>
Before they died I want to live out of the <unk>
Before they died -- I want to leave you with a <unk> once you know.
Before they died I want to go to the <unk>
Before they died I want to be completely <unk>
And this space, it became <unk> and the dreams and dreams of people asked me to tell me what I would do, and I would go back to <unk>
It's about to know that you're not alone. It's about to understand our neighbors of new ways -- it's about giving rise to the reflection and the <unk> and remembering what is most important for us as we have, and we need to know that it's more important for us as well.
This happened last year, and I started getting hundreds of messages from young people who wanted to make a wall in their community in their community.
And so with my colleagues in the middle of the pyramid, we made a <unk> and now they have been developed in countries around the world, like <unk> South Africa, South Africa.
Together, we showed the power of our public spaces if we give us the opportunity to understand it.
Two of the hardest things we have is the time and our relationships with other people.
In our <unk> it was more important than ever, to be more important than ever, and I remember that life is a little bit more and more important than that.
The death is one of what they often do about, or even thinking, but I understood that the death of the death is one of those things that we can do more power.
And I think in the death of our lifetime.
Our spaces can help us better what we care as individuals and as a community and more media to share <unk> fears and stories, the people that surrounds us not only to help improve our lives.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Today, I have a only <unk>
Please, I don't tell me that I'm a normal one.
Now I would like to introduce you to my <unk>
It was 22 years old, it's high and very exciting.
It's not fun, but it's so much better than some of the best <unk>
<unk> knows what's going to be that <unk>
So what you can do is you can see what it looks like.
It's not <unk> It's not the color of the spinal cord of the brain.
And I don't care about human differences, and you think about it:  has never been <unk>
So when I went out of our childhood, trying to figure out the words that I didn't even know if I could, I reminds me of what we know about the mind and the wonderful thing that should be the <unk>
Samuel <unk> It's a little bit <unk> It's very interesting.
It would be more <unk> more <unk>
However, it's a lot of energy.
I didn't remember if I knew my <unk> but it reminds me of the year that it came up every one of the songs of my iPod, conversations that we took when I was four years old, and I would say in my arm during the first episode of <unk>
I don't look like this.
But most of the people are not very good.
And in fact, because their minds are not <unk> the concept of poverty is often <unk> and <unk>
But what propelled me to my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, although I didn't think about it, that would only mean one thing, that they were <unk>
Now, for those less familiar words, with the term <unk> is a complex behavior that affects social communication, learning and sometimes the skills are going to work.
In every individual <unk> in a different way of there that <unk> whether it's as different as possible.
And in all the world, every 20 minutes, it would be a new case of autism, and even though it is one of the development in the developing world, there are no cause for <unk>
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without it.
I had only three years when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited about having a new being in my life.
When it was a few months ago, I realized that he was different.
<unk>
I didn't want to play as the other babies, and in fact, it didn't really seem very interested in me at all.
<unk> lived and <unk> in their own world, with their own rules, and I found pleasure in the smaller things, like putting the cars in line around the room, looking at the <unk> and eating any thing that would have been between <unk>
And as I was growing up, and the differences were made more <unk> and the differences were <unk>
But beyond the <unk> the frustration and the <unk> there was something that was really <unk> a <unk> nature and a child who saw the world without any human being ever <unk>
<unk> <unk>
I can't deny that there have been some moments in my family, times where I would have thought that they were just like I was just like I was just like I was just like me.
But I look back to the things that have taught me about <unk> communication, and love, and I realize that they're things that I don't want to change for it.
Now, the <unk> the beauty that we give us the differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean that some is good.
It just means that there's a different view of what's going on.
If I could <unk> a single thing to <unk> and to Sam and you would be that you don't have to be <unk>
They can be <unk>
Because, you know, if you will, or not, the differences that we <unk> are a <unk> each of us has a gift on their inside and, rather than the pursuit of <unk> is the last <unk>
So the opportunity for <unk> progress and change in the moment where we try to be like the ones that we try to be like the <unk>
And so I don't tell me that I'm normal to tell me that I'm normal for me.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a bit of what it should have been <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>
So I asked me to tell me a book, a communications, a communications, which gave a class of communication, and a team of <unk>
I was <unk>   <unk> <unk> of these students with their great ideas, their big books, their big books, and the big books and the big books and the <unk>
But in order to get those conversations, I felt what I would do, I would have sense when I went through the hole and saw the door of a new world.
And so I sat down and I sat down and I sat those conversations with the students and I wanted the ideas to do, and I wanted them to do this wonderful thing.
And I think the key to opening up that door is a great success.
We need desperately a great communication communication and engineers with the end of the world.
Our engineers and engineers are the ones that are developing, our biggest challenges of energy and healthcare, between each other, and if we don't know about this, the work is not fact, and I think it's our responsibility as we have these <unk>
But these big conversations can't happen if our scientists and engineers are not going to look at their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, because of course, because of a <unk>
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure that your science is <unk> and that your engineering is <unk>
First question for <unk> and then why?
And so the science is relevant to us.
We don't say to tell us about the <unk> but we call the <unk> which are the structure of our bones, because it's important to understand and try and try and try and make the <unk>
And when you're describing your science with <unk>
The <unk> is an obstacle to our ideas.
You can say <unk> and <unk> but why don't we say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us.
<unk> <unk> not the same thing that it would be <unk>
Now, as you say Einstein, like Einstein, who are as simple as possible, but it doesn't matter to you.
You can communicate it clearly their science without paying attention.
One thing to consider is to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be <unk> and <unk> are ways of doing it.
And at the end of their work, of the signs of <unk>
They have wondered why they call <unk>  What do you do about <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> its <unk>
A <unk> like this is not only because this is not surprisingly, but it makes it too much in the area of our brain and we <unk>
Instead, this <unk> of example of <unk> Brown is a lot more effective, shown that the special structure of <unk> is so strong that I really inspired the only design of the <unk>
The trick here is to use a simple phrase <unk> that the public can understand if you lose a bit, and, then to provide action to our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding of what it is.
I think these are just some key ones that can help us get the door to the door and look at the country that is the science and the <unk>
And so scientists and engineers, when you have <unk> this equation, by all the media, <unk> with <unk>  Thank you. Thank you.
And one of my favorite words of all the <unk> of English is <unk>
Just because it sounds very good.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk> <unk>
Even if there was an editor of the 19th century, which makes a lot better when he said, <unk> <unk> is the thing that you can look at a public store without a <unk> platform or principle, which is the <unk> use of a <unk> <unk>
I don't have no idea what it means to be <unk>
One thing that you see with the words, <unk>
It's very important that the words are the basis of politics, and that all politicians know that they have to be able to deal with it.
It wasn't <unk> for example, <unk> for example, <unk> that Parliament had been allowed to do the same words that they were talking about in the video camera that were said in the <unk>
And all of this was because of the courage of a guy with the name of the <unk> <unk> <unk> who was born in <unk>
I sat down in the suburbs of London and said, but it was enough to go back to them, and at the end he had such popular support in London that had been <unk>
And just a few years later we had the first use of the phrase <unk> <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk>
Most of you think it's a <unk>
This is because it's a <unk> of freedom of <unk>
But to show you how the words and politics are, I want you to go back to the United States, just after the <unk>
So they had to deal with the question of how to call George Washington and <unk> her <unk>
They don't do it.
How do you get to the leader of a <unk>
This is <unk> in Congress for a long time.
They were made all kinds of suggestions that might be <unk>
Some wanted to call it <unk> <unk> and others, <unk> <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the United States.
It's not very <unk>
Some simply wanted to call it <unk>
It thought that it was about <unk>
And I don't even know that they were <unk> they had the idea that you could be able to be chosen by a <unk>
And I could have <unk>
All of the world came out -- because this debate would be <unk> for three months.
So the city of a poor <unk> and always <unk> <unk> with this <unk>
And what caused the <unk> and the <unk> was that the <unk> House was in the <unk>
The House of <unk> I didn't want the Washington to <unk>
They didn't want to call it <unk> by whether they were going to give him their own ideas.
And so they wanted to give the title of the most <unk> and most popular things that we were doing.
And that title was <unk>
So we didn't have the <unk> There was no time there before, but only meant to be <unk>
It was like the president of a <unk>
And I didn't have a lot more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There were <unk> <unk> of little <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> but it was really a good idea.
And so the United States would be <unk>
They said, "No, no, we can't do it.
"This guy has to ask them to ask them to sign their <unk>
And who would you take care of a brilliant title and go to the president of <unk>
And finally, after three weeks, the United States fell not <unk>
We can learn three interesting things about this.
First of all, and this is my favorite to where I've been able to figure out the Senate has never been <unk>
The President Barack Obama has sort of going to keep there, hoping that the Senate between the <unk> in action.
The second thing that we can learn is that when a government says that a government is <unk>   <unk> possible that we have waiting for <unk> years more.
But the third thing that we can learn and this is the most important thing, and with this -- I want to talk about the title of the U.S. President of the United States in the morning.
All of them have more than five nuclear power to restore the world's largest economy in the world and a fleet of oil vehicles, and so on.
The truth and story have been at the title of <unk>
So at the end he won the <unk>
<unk> his title of <unk> her <unk>
And also the other concern about the appearance of <unk> well, it was a <unk>
But you know how many nations have now <unk>
And all because they want to sound like the guy who has the right old and so on.
So at the end of the end of the Cold War, and the <unk> <unk> because nobody is going to feel <unk> when you tell them that they're now President of <unk>
And I think that is the big lesson that we can learn and what I would like to do with <unk>
The politicians are trying to choose and use the words to shape and control reality, but really, the really important thing to do more the words that these might change the reality.
Thank you. Thank you.
I'm 45 to eight meters under earth in an illegal <unk>
The air is carbon and powder and it is hard to go.
I feel the weight of <unk> bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I met them who speak but about it, but about everything, that <unk> <unk> and stones and stones with <unk> <unk>
As the other ones I have -- I've got a chemical fiber of light from the head with this <unk> <unk> and I can also take the <unk> branches that take the walls of that hole from that hole from that hole into the air.
It was <unk> my hand and suddenly I remember one of a sudden I met days before, who lost control and fell in the <unk>
Now, as I talk with you today, these men are in the deep sense of that hole -- their lives no longer pay reward and, often, <unk>
I came out of that hole and I went home, but they might never be able to do it, because they are <unk> because they're <unk>
In the last 50 years I was documenting cultures, <unk> in over 70 countries in six continents and in 2009, I had the great honor of being the only <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>
Among all the amazing people I met there I met in the <unk> of <unk> the <unk> an NGO that was working to eradicate the <unk>
We started talking about slavery and really, I started to learn about slavery because I knew there was a world in the world but not just at least <unk>
So when we end up talking to me, I felt very important. I was going to ignore this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know.
And he made me <unk> the stomach and weeks later, I flew in Los Angeles to meet the CEO of <unk> the <unk> and the <unk>
So I started my journey to slavery at the time.
Interestingly, there were already been a lot of these <unk>
So anyway, even the <unk> my second home.
But this time, <unk> <unk>
A little <unk> says that there's more 27 million people in the world.
It's twice from the number of Africans getting out during the <unk>
Over 150 years the cost of a farmer was about three times the annual salary of a U.S. worker worker from a U.S. worker worker from an United States.
The equivalent of about 50 years ago.
However, today you can go back to local families for generations of <unk> <unk>
Secondly, the slavery takes more than 500 million dollars a year in the world.
Many have been <unk> with certain kinds of good education, and better work for then to discover that they're forced to work with no <unk> under threat of violence and can't afford.
Today, the slavery works in the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> you have value, but those are the <unk>
The slavery is in almost all the world and, yet it's illegal in the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the <unk> <unk>
This strange thing and the <unk> was like being the old Egypt or the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> in a temperature of <unk> C, men, women, women, children, <unk> <unk> <unk> in a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in their hands up to 18 at the time, and they put them in the <unk>
I would go through the <unk> and the <unk> work in silence, doing this task and again for 16 -- 17 hours a day.
And I didn't know that for free, not to drink, and I would be able to touch it out of a pretty <unk>
By <unk> they were the heat and the powder that my camera got too cold, and I left my hand.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean the team and make it out with air, and sitting there, like, my camera is a much better treatment than these people.
So in the <unk> I wanted to convince him, but the <unk> that I was going to my side -- and he said, <unk> don't do it, but I don't do it.
And he explained to me very clearly that to prove to emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me but for them.
I couldn't make sure any help you ever heard.
I can't give you money, anything.
I was not in that country.
I could put them in a very worst situation of which we were already <unk>
I had to rely on <unk> the <unk> and working within the system because of his liberation and <unk> which I would <unk>
In the way to me, I was going to get home to feel my heart <unk>
In the 1980s, I found out the stones with stones and <unk> and so they were waiting for trucks that they were waiting for.
Those big <unk> were more <unk> than the children who had <unk> and children would go back to their heads with <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
It's hard to see something so <unk>
How can we influence something as <unk> but so <unk> but so <unk>
Some don't even know that they're <unk> and they work 16  17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been all his life.
They don't have anything to do.
And when these <unk> <unk> their freedom to <unk> their families, their families, their families, their families.
When you hear the word <unk> you often think of sexual traffic and because of this global consciousness that would be hard for me to work with security in this particular business in Africa.
In <unk> I asked me <unk> women who had been threatened by <unk>
I would put it for a few months -- that we took this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was more <unk>
<unk> as it is known in <unk> are local and <unk>
They have different rooms where <unk> <unk> with their girls and children, some of them just seven years old, are forced to pay attention to the clients and they would buy more food and <unk>
Every <unk> is dark and <unk> by a number painted on the wall and put it by a <unk> and a <unk>
The workers often have sexual sexual sexual sexual services to their clients, their customers, their customers, their neighbors.
On foot in the <unk> I remember having sense of a <unk> fear and, in that way, I could just imagine what it should be in that <unk>
And I just had a <unk> of the <unk> where it was <unk>
There were no <unk> <unk>
There were no big windows as well as to <unk>
Those people don't have <unk> and, you know, it would be a matter so difficult, it's important to point out that the <unk> even sexual sexual traffic around us.
There are hundreds of thousands of people in agriculture, in India, in <unk> in <unk> and the list can go back to it.
On the New York Times, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300 children were sold every year as they were in the <unk>
This is for us, but we don't see it.
The <unk> are another activity that often related to the hand of <unk> <unk>
They were the Japanese villages where there were local families in the trade of <unk>
This is a portrait of his family.
The hands of black hands are the <unk> hands of blue and yellow and red of their kids.
<unk> <unk> in these big barrels and <unk> silk in the liquid to the <unk> but the <unk> is <unk>
My grandfather told me their stories.
We don't have <unk>
We don't know that we can go out of this house one day and go to another place where we actually pay our <unk>
This is estimated that there are more than 4,000 children in the lake and the largest lake in the world.
So when I went to the <unk> I went to a little bit.
I saw what it seemed to be a family of fishermen in a boat, two brothers -- some kids more young, it has sense right?
<unk> were all <unk>
Now, the kids are <unk> their families and their families -- and he forced him to work in these black holes in the middle of the Cold War.
This child has eight years.
And when our boat came up with the subject of <unk> that their little <unk> were <unk>
He was paralyzed by the fear of his water.
The <unk> branches of the trees in the spring -- and they often go through networks and kids, and with respect to the water to make the <unk>
Many <unk>
Since he has always been forced to work on the ground.
For fear to her love not going to be, and, as the entire life has been treated with <unk> <unk> it is the most young boy under his head.
I met these guys at the five o'clock in the morning, when I met the last networks, but they had been working from the <unk>
On the night, and <unk> at the night, in the night, and <unk>
And it will be to point out that these green networks are more than 400 pounds per hour.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was born in a <unk> village in <unk>
I met him in a shop in the <unk> which <unk> the <unk> of the <unk>
What does that mean?
Who will get to be because someone decided to make the difference in their life?
It would be a road in Ghana with partners of <unk> the <unk> a <unk> <unk> with her <unk> and <unk> our car, our car and put the <unk>
We asked them to do it for a way of the land to the <unk>
At the end of the way, we would go out of the car, and asked the driver to go back and asked them to go away.
And then you put this piece in the middle and said, "This is the way, this is the way.
And as we started <unk> we took the <unk> that we would put the way and after a time we found out about an hour of an hour we found out that the way was <unk> by recent <unk> so I put the team of pictures on my head as a <unk>
And after two hours of <unk> the <unk> path ended up in one of them, and we had in front of a holes in front of a holes that could fit in a sports camp, and they were all full of them.
Many women were had children who were killed by their <unk> and, while they were looking at <unk> <unk> in <unk>
The <unk> is used in the process.
These <unk> are <unk> in a <unk> in a part of the United States.
When they came out of the <unk> they were <unk> in their own <unk>
I remember I looked at his eyes, so that many had been under the ground for 72 months.
They are all up to 90 meters and these people have <unk> <unk> <unk> and then they will be applied to another area where we <unk> the <unk> to be able to extract the <unk>
In the first view, the site seems to be full of strong men and <unk> but if we look at more closely, we can see the other one and also children.
They're all victims of <unk> diseases and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> would end up as this victim of <unk> and the <unk> in a few years.
This is <unk> When her father died his father gave him to work with him in the <unk>
When they die in their <unk> <unk> <unk> the debt of the uncle what force to be <unk> in the <unk>
And when I met him, I met him at 14 years and the year of the leg of the leg that you see here is a product of an accident in <unk> so serious that doctors were saying to be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has HIV, and, not yet that, it's forced to work on night and day in that age.
And yet, he helped him to be released and successful with help from local activists like <unk> the <unk> and the <unk> and this kind of <unk> of face to a chance to make a lot of money.
I want to send light to the <unk>
Did you know that your images would be seen by you around the world.
I wanted to know that we were going to take testimony of them and we will do everything we could to help change their lives.
And I think if we can see some other as human beings, then it makes it very hard to tolerate atrocities like the <unk>
These images are not from <unk> they're from <unk> people -- people like you and I, who deserve the same sexual rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There's not one day that I would say in these many different people as well as I've had the great honor of <unk>
I hope that these images will be a force in the people like you, and I hope that the force goes up a fire and that <unk> light on slavery -- because, without that light, the <unk> of slavery can continue to live in the <unk>
Thank you. Thank you.
I do math and there's a simple problem for who the <unk> are like the <unk> <unk> are like the <unk>
No one knows what the hell we do.
So today I'm going to try to explain to you what I do.
The dance is one of the most human activities is one of the most distant activities of the United States.
We were <unk> the <unk> the <unk> and the dancers of <unk>  that we will see more <unk>
But the demand for the heart of training is a high level of quality and probably a lot of the initial figures that might well have a biological component that could be a biological component that could be a biological component that could be a biological component that could be a biological component that could be a biological component that could be a biological component that could be a biological
Meanwhile, mental disorders like the evil of Parkinson's disease, <unk> this <unk> ability as it does with my friend <unk> <unk> who, in his case, it was a <unk>
In the last few years it has been a lot of work in the <unk>
However, there are <unk> millions of people in the world who are alive, and they have to deal with <unk> <unk> <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need tools to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure progress in an objective way, and, indeed, the only way that we know whether there's a cure to be when we have an objective of objective and <unk>
But it is <unk> that for the Parkinson's and other disorders of the movement, they don't have <unk> <unk> so they don't get the analysis of blood and the best thing that we have is <unk>
So you have to go to a clinic to do this. It's very, very accurately and that means that it was on the trials that you had never seen before.
And what if patients were able to do it in <unk>
That would be a trip to the <unk> What if patients were able to do the test they would be <unk>
You don't need to be <unk>
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the clinic in <unk>
So what I want to do with you as a conventional shape for a few minutes you can see, in a sense at least we are all <unk> as my friend <unk>
This is a video of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It shows someone right now, as it turns out to be a <unk> We can imagine as the dancers of a <unk> <unk> because we have to coordinate all of these <unk> organs to produce sound and all we have <unk>
And as the <unk> requires a level of training -- and as <unk>
Let's look at the time that it takes a child to learn to speak to you.
From the sound of sound, we can track the position of <unk> as <unk> and as the Parkinson's affects the <unk> it affects the <unk> it's also the <unk>
In the <unk> you can see an example of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>
We see the same <unk>
Do you pay <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And the <unk> becomes more <unk> and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the <unk>
How can you compare these tests based on the voice with <unk> clinical trials -- well, both of these are not <unk>
The test of the test is not <unk> both use <unk>
It's not necessary to design a whole range of hospitals to make sure that we can do a whole range of hospitals for you.
Both of them are good. Okay, but in addition to <unk> <unk> are not <unk>
I mean, you can be <unk>
They are doing very quickly, they take about 30 seconds like a lot of a lot of a lot of money.
They are less than 50 percent, and we all know what happens to happen to it.
When you get a cost so <unk> it comes to the <unk>
And these are some amazing goals ready for <unk>
We can reduce the <unk> <unk> of the patients.
I don't need to go to the clinic for the first time.
With <unk> <unk> we could get the data to get rid of it.
We could make massive <unk> <unk> <unk> for clinical trials and, for the first time, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of disease before it's too late.
So at the age of spending the first steps in that sense, we are looking at the New York Times.
Along with <unk> and <unk> we want to take a lot of voices across the world to collect enough data and start to deal with these <unk>
We have <unk> local <unk> for about 600 million people in the world.
It would be <unk> or without Parkinson's disease, you can call <unk> for a few seconds, and I'm happy to say that we've already reached the head of the goal in just eight months.
Thank you.     I took all these samples of, let's say 10 minutes of, say, 10 people, you can say who is good, and who is this?
What would you get from these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, well, what happens is that during the call you have to tell if you have or not the heart attack, it would be a disease.
So you see, some people can be <unk> it might not be a <unk>
But we're going to get a very big sample of data in different ways, and do it in different circumstances is important because we are looking for <unk> factors in search factors in the real <unk>
TR: You have a <unk> <unk> in this <unk>
<unk> a lot more than that.
Actually, my graduate student -- I have that <unk> has made a fantastic work and now it has shown that it works in the spinal cord also, which <unk> the project, we now have a double <unk>
TR: Thank you.    Well, it's a <unk>
<unk>
TR: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
<unk> Thank you. Thank you.
Before March of March of 2011, I had <unk> <unk> in New York City.
We're creatures <unk>
We were <unk> in the dark, but not windows and so often it would take light into the solar surface.
We do the <unk> models, even more <unk> the red skin still doesn't exist, and we will be able to get them in the press all the time, but some of us are really artists with a lot of artists with many years of experience with the images and the <unk>
On March of March 2011, I saw from my house, like the rest of the world, the events that are happening in Japan.
And so far, an organization where an organization where it was <unk> in the middle of the room working as part of the <unk>
I, along with hundreds of other volunteers we knew that we couldn't go sitting sitting sitting at home, so I decided to join the group for three months.
Three of May <unk> traveled to <unk>
This is a small village of fishermen in the <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the first villages of the first villages in the world.
The sea level of water took me over 24 hours and over three miles a year.
As you can imagine, the village was <unk>
We take the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> and we took the <unk> and we left houses for being <unk> and <unk>
We took tons and tons of fish out of the <unk>
We were <unk> and we asked us to do it.
During weeks, so the volunteers as the neighbors were found out of the physical things that the neighbors were found out.
They found pictures and <unk> of pictures and cameras, and they said, <unk> <unk>
They all did it.
<unk> and <unk> and <unk> them in different places around the villages of <unk>
It wasn't until so I realized that those pictures inspired a huge part of the personal issues, that people had <unk>
Meanwhile, the <unk> and to save their lives, they had to take all their lives, they had to leave everything they want.
At the end of my first week I started to help in a <unk> center of the people.
It helped to clean <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
This place it turned out to be the place of the village where the middle of the <unk> came up with the <unk>
And so I had the honor of that day that day I would put myself in my hand at the top of my hand.
This was exciting and inspiring, and I had heard the expression of thinking beyond the <unk> but it wasn't until I was in the same way that something happened.
By looking at the pictures, I found some that they had more than a hundred years were still in the lab, I couldn't help to help think like <unk> how to fix that <unk> and make hundreds of people who could do it.
So that night I walked on Facebook, I started with some of them, and the next morning the answer was so great, and so I knew that we had to do it.
So we started to <unk>
This was the first of all, this was the first one.
It wasn't too <unk> but where the water had <unk> the face of the girl should be <unk> with a lot of accuracy and <unk>
On the other hand, that little girl, I wouldn't have the aspect of it, and that would be as tragic as having the picture of the photo <unk>
With the time of time, they came up with a lot more pictures and they needed more <unk> so it went back into Facebook and <unk> and five days later 80 percent of the people in the United States.
At the age of two weeks I had 150 people <unk>
In Japan, we took us to <unk> a village at the north of <unk>
And once the week we put our scanner in the <unk> and we were able to give them <unk> where people were going to collect their <unk>
So the time that we <unk> in <unk> is a different story of the <unk> of <unk>
I could make a <unk> I could have a <unk>
I could make a few months.
So this <unk> had to draw any hand using the <unk> areas whose colors and detail, the water was not <unk>
I took a lot of time.
The water destroyed all these pictures out of water, covered by bacteria, with <unk> even with oil all that along with the <unk> of the time I get <unk> for that <unk> was a part of the project.
We can't <unk> the picture unless it was <unk> <unk> and would have been <unk> by their <unk>
We were lucky with the <unk>
We have a <unk> of a <unk>
It's very easy to reduce the pictures already -- even more the pictures already <unk>
And as a result, the leader of my group is like doing a <unk>
You can't do it. You can't do it."
The woman who brought us these pictures in relation to the <unk>
There were starting to be a <unk> she was ready to realize that the <unk> even more.
I also had <unk> <unk>
Without them, the images of their husband and their own face would not have been able to detect the images in a single picture of a single picture and <unk>
And when they showed their pictures of their story with us.
A few colleagues of his husband found the pictures in a forest station between the '60s, very far from where he used to be his house, but his colleagues would <unk>
The day of the tsunami, her husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the <unk>
He had to go into the water as <unk>
Their kids small children are not so small now, but their two children were in school in different places.
One of them was trapped in the water.
It took a week to find all his family and know that everybody had <unk>
The day that the day she got his name on his own <unk>
By that, despite all this, those pictures were the best gift that he could <unk> something that he could go back to it, something that I could remember of the past that I could remember of the past day when everything in your life changed or was <unk>
And after six months in Japan found volunteers who had come up with a hundred of them -- hundreds of thousands of them helped us hold their hand more than 50,000 photographs -- and the great majority came up with their <unk>
More than 500 volunteers from all around the world taught us to bring 90 percent of them completely <unk> and <unk>
Over this time, we actually don't spend more than 50 billion dollars in teams and materials, most of them <unk>
We take pictures of them.
A picture is a picture of someone or something, a relationship, a relationship, and someone else.
They are <unk> of our memories and stories, the last thing we do, but the first thing that we are going to do is <unk>
So this was the project to restore small pieces of humanity, of giving someone their connection to the past, with the past.
So when a picture like this one would put someone, it's a huge difference in the life of the person who <unk>
This project also made a huge difference in life in the <unk> of <unk>
So some of them would put them with something more special to get something, using their talent for something that they don't be able to be <unk>
So to end I would end up to read this email -- I was sent to the day I went from Japan after six months.
As I <unk> I couldn't help think about people and the stories that we found in the <unk>
One in particular, a picture with the different women of the grandmother from the grandmother to the grandmother to a small girl -- came out of a baby, and she said, "Well, because a similar picture of my grandmother my grandmother, my grandmother, and my daughter just <unk>
In the entire world, in all the few different aspects of our basic needs.
Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.
<unk> <unk> We were inspired by <unk> and curiosity with this picture of a bullet on an airplane in an exhibition of only a <unk>
But now, 50 years later, we can go up a million times faster and see the world not to a million or a billion or a billion of them -- but a billion of them are <unk>
Let me show you a new type of <unk> <unk> a new technique that can create videos of light on the surface of light in space.
And with that we can create cameras, which you can see after the <unk> of the vision, or see the inside of the body without using fish, and actually the idea of camera.
If I take a laser on a laser and turn it into a second of a second or a second -- in several <unk> to create a package of photons in just a square square inch.
And that package of you -- that <unk> travel at the speed of light, and, again, a million times faster than a common <unk> and that <unk>
If you take that bullet and this package of photons and fold in this bottle, how do you get those photons inside of this <unk>
What's the thing about light in a <unk>
Now, all --         remember that all this happens in less than a <unk> is what it takes to travel the light into the light to the light that it takes to travel the light into the light -- it is what it takes to travel into the light up.
But this video is 10 billion times so much so that you can see the light on the surface.
A young boy --          -- a lot of things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what is going on.
The <unk> our <unk> comes in the bottle with a package of photons that starts to <unk> and that, you start to <unk>
And part of the light gets to the table, and we started to see these <unk>
Many of the photons eventually come to the <unk> and then <unk> in various ways.
And as you can see, there's a bubble of air that bounces up in the sky.
In that time, the waves travel on the table, and because of the top of the top of the upper part of the bottle, after several <unk> that the <unk> are <unk>
Now, if we take a common ball and current and we do it at the same distance and we see it in a direct distance to about 10 billion times, how you think we would take it to the <unk>
A <unk> A <unk> is actually a <unk>
It would be a very simple movie --  from a <unk> <unk> in <unk>
And what we can test with nature <unk>
You can see the waves that go from the table, and the wall of the bottom of the wall.
This is how we put a rock in a <unk>
This is the way nature paints a picture, and I think about a <unk> at the time, but of course our eyes look a little bit.
But if you look at the right time -- you'll notice that as the light comes out of the body, it's not a <unk>
Why? Because the <unk> is <unk> and light bounces into their inside and it comes to a number of <unk> and so on.
In the future, when this <unk> is in their cell phones, they're going to be able to go to the grocery store, and check if car is <unk> without having to <unk>
So why we created this camera in the <unk>
As a child, you know, if you take a picture to a <unk> it comes very long enough, it comes very long enough.
But we're going to be a billion times faster than the smallest exhibition -- so we can just get something of light.
We were able to put that <unk> -- millions of times, and we recorded one and again, with a very <unk> <unk> we took those <unk> of data and <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I would give you the <unk>
We can take all of these data, and we need to take all of those data in a very interesting way.
Superman can make it <unk>
Other teachers can become <unk>
And if a new power of a future would allow them to see after the <unk>
So the idea is that we could put some light on the <unk> and go into the room, one part is going to happen on the door, and from there to the camera, to the camera, to the camera, to the camera, to the camera, to the camera, to the camera, to the camera, and from there to the camera, to the camera, to the camera, to the camera, to
And where we could get those multiple <unk> of light.
It's not science -- we've already seen it.
On the left is our <unk>
And the other thing on the wall is a <unk> and <unk> light on the ground.
And then after about our article in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And a small fraction of the photons go back to the camera, but interestingly, in moments of different ways.
And as we have a camera that works so quickly, our <unk> has <unk> abilities to <unk>
It has very good resolution and you can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the height of the door and also to the very basic objects but we don't know what the point corresponds to what it is.
In fact, a laser can actually record a picture in town, which you see on the screen, you really don't have any sense, it doesn't have any sense.
But we make a lot of images like this, tens of thousands of images, and we will try to analyze the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we can see the object <unk>
We're going to see it in <unk>
This is our <unk>
We have things to explore before we take this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that are going to be able to make decisions with what's going on on the surface.
And we could look at survivors in dangerous conditions, looking at the light out of the dark windows there.
And we could build a <unk> able to see the inside of the body, and the same thing for the <unk>
But of course, because of the tissue, and the blood of this is quite difficult, so actually this is a set of scientists for scientists to start thinking about the <unk> as a new <unk> to solve the problems of the next generation.
So as a <unk> he became a scientist, he became the science in art, a art of photographs <unk>
I realized that all the <unk> of data that we collect every time are not only for a federal <unk>
We can create a new way of 3D 3D, with direct code and code of colors, and it looks like this.
And we look at these <unk> Remember, the time between every one of those waves are just about <unk>
But here it also happens to be a <unk>
If we look at the waves below the <unk> these are the <unk> of us.
The waves should move towards us.
What does that mean?
It turns out, as we are looking at the speed of light, we have <unk> effects, and Einstein would have <unk> to see this image.
The order that happen in the world in the world sometimes have invested in the camera.
And we would be able to make the whole range of space and time, we can <unk> this <unk>
It's not time. Thank you.
Hello. This is my phone <unk>
A mobile phone can be <unk> life, and gives you freedom of <unk>
With a mobile phone, you can get a car against humanity in <unk>
With a mobile phone, you can send a message and start a <unk> in <unk>
With a mobile phone you can record a song, put a song, put it into <unk>
All of this is possible with a <unk>
I am a <unk> of <unk> and I live in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to this place to this city.
Here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people <unk> in a change.
This is the end of <unk> imagine if all of these people showed that <unk> on a change, had a mobile phone in the <unk>
Who of them have a mobile phone.
<unk> <unk>
Raise your cell phone.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's a lot of all over the world.
But today I'm talking about me, of my mobile phone, and how it changed my life.
I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35 <unk> lines of information.
<unk>
Why is that information going on?
Because in the summer of 2006 the Global Goals made a <unk> <unk>
The <unk> of <unk> of <unk>
This board says that every single company that every single company of all across Europe, has to store a whole range of information from the <unk>
Who called the <unk>
Who would send you a text to <unk>
And if we use the mobile phone, where we are.
So all this information is sold for at least six months, and until two years ago in your phone company or its <unk>
And in the entire Europe people have met and said, "We don't want it to <unk>
They said that they didn't want this <unk>
We want the <unk> in the digital era and we don't want the carriers and the <unk> of the Internet <unk> all this information on us.
There were lawyers who said, "Well, we all said, "We want to <unk>
And here you can see about ten thousand people who came to the streets of Berlin and said, <unk> not <unk>
And some even said that this would be the <unk>
The <unk> was the secret police of Germany in the United States.
And I also asked me if this is what I wanted to do.
You can store all this information on us about it.
Every time you use the <unk>
So I asked my mother, <unk> <unk> that at that time, it was the largest mobile phone company that I had for favor of all the information they were on me.
And I asked them once, and I went to <unk> and I didn't have a <unk> <unk> it was all <unk>
But then I said, I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
So I decided to <unk> a police lawsuit because I wanted to have this information, because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said no, we don't take this information, but we will take this information.
At the end of the end of the night.
<unk> the demand and they would put me the information that I would <unk>
Meanwhile, the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for the U.S. law for the United States of America.
So I got this kind of amazing thing on brown with a <unk>
And in <unk> there was this.
And five thousand <unk> of information.
At the first time, I saw and said, well, it's a very nice one.
But after a time I realized that it's my life.
There are six months of my life in this country.
It was a little <unk> what should do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where the night, what I'm doing, what I'm doing.
But then I said, I want to make this information <unk>
I mean, I want to change it.
Because I want to show people what the vast majority of data is the <unk> <unk>
So next to <unk> <unk> and Sierra Leone.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can go back and go back and start to go back and look at it.
You can see every step that I <unk>
And you can see how I'm going to go to the train to <unk> and what I often call the <unk>
All this is possible with this information, with all this information.
That's a little bit of <unk>
But it's not just about me.
But of all of us.
First of all, there are things like, I call my wife and she wants me to talk a couple of times.
And then I call me a few friends and they call them the <unk>
And then one called the other, and the other one to another, and we end up with this huge network of <unk>
So you can see how their people are communicating between themselves to what happens to each other, what time you want.
You can see all this.
You can see the <unk> the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what's doing the society.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Afghanistan.
This is a model to study the shape of your society, because you know who talks with who, who would put an email to who, all this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is sold at least six months in Europe, and until two years ago.
As I said at the beginning, imagine if all these people in the streets of Berlin, at the end of 1989, they got a mobile phone in the <unk>
And the <unk> would have known who was in this conflict, and, if the <unk> would have known who were the leaders, this was never <unk>
The every one of the <unk> of Berlin would probably have to do it.
And in a sense, the every one of the <unk> of <unk>
Because today the state agencies and companies want to store so much information as possible as possible within and out of the <unk>
They want to have the possibility of getting our lives and want to be <unk> for everyone.
But the <unk> and living in the digital era is not a <unk>
But today you have to fight for <unk>
You have to pay for that to the other side.
When you go home, tell your friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century, and it's not just a lot of <unk>
When you go home, I'll tell her that only because the companies and the agencies can store some information, they don't have to do it.
And if I don't believe me, you ask her story about how much information they want.
So in the future, every time you use your mobile phones to remember that you have to fight for the <unk> in the <unk>
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Okay. So what happens?
It's not enough.
Okay. So what happens?
I call <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but the doctor who brought me to the world.
And I asked my mom six times in six different directions, <unk> the poor of me in the process.
And as a result, I have cerebral palsy, so that we will get all the time.
Thank you.
It's <unk> I'm a mix of <unk>
<unk> and <unk>
<unk> <unk> is not <unk>
It's not <unk> nor can you <unk>
No one <unk> the <unk> of my mother and not the <unk> because my parents were talking about.
It just happens for accidents, as I came to the <unk>
Now, I'm going to give you <unk> I'm not the source of <unk> and I don't want any of you here.
I feel bad for me, because at some time of life, you've got to be <unk>
We're from <unk>
<unk> <unk> are at the heart rate in circles in circles and what happens in the <unk>
16 <unk> <unk> and 16 <unk>
And you know, you know, I can be at least a little <unk>
But also, I say, I have the 99 problems, and the <unk> <unk> is just one of them.
In there is a <unk> of <unk> I would get the <unk>
I'm a <unk> Sir <unk> <unk> and I live in New York.
If you don't feel better, maybe you should do it.
I'm a <unk> in New York.
I always loved my neighborhood and my disease had the same <unk>
I also love that if I want to walk out of my house to New York City.
Many people with cerebral palsy, but my parents don't believe in the <unk>
The mantra of my father was: Can you be able to dance <unk>
If my three sisters <unk> I would be <unk> I would be <unk>
If my three sisters were going to the public school, my parents would go to the school system, and they would be able to do it, and if they didn't get them all over the top of my mother.
My father taught me to walk at the five years putting my <unk> in his feet and simply to give them <unk>
The other iteration that I used was to put a dollar in front of me so that I would do it.
The <unk> that I have in it was very strong and <unk>
Yes. The first day in the middle of the room was going to be a <unk> <unk> which has been a lot of <unk>
When they grow up in my city and they were all of the family.
Now there are 20 <unk> and keep all of the family.  I think nobody realized we were not <unk> we were not <unk>
This was before September 11, and what the politicians would think would be to be able to use <unk> as well as <unk>
The people who grew up in the audience were not having problems with my own <unk>
However, it seemed to be <unk> so much of hunger during the <unk>
I told them that he had enough fat to live three months to live three months without knowing what was going to be <unk>
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yes, in <unk> it's <unk>  My parents couldn't afford the physical therapy -- so I told him the physical therapy of <unk>
I learned to dance with <unk> or whether I can walk with <unk> <unk>
I am a <unk> New Jersey, and there we want to be <unk> so if my friends were using <unk> I was as <unk>
And when my friends were going to spend the summer of summer in the <unk> I would not go back to it.
And I spent my time in a war, because my parents were willing to go back to Palestine all the <unk> all the <unk> all <unk>
In the summer of summer as often my father was trying to <unk> so I would put milk out of it, put them up in the air, and I remember the water, and I remember the water and I would say, <unk> your eyes and I, <unk>
But the cure for <unk> was <unk>
I should say that it's very boring, but before you do it, it was a <unk> <unk> which could not be <unk>
And now I can do it in my head.
My parents <unk> this idea that I could make any sense that any dream was impossible, and my dream was to be in the <unk>
I was at college by college by college by the <unk> and I got a grant for the <unk> University of Pittsburgh because I went in all the <unk>
It was like the <unk> <unk> of the <unk>
All of me <unk>
So I did all the tasks of the least intelligent, I put the top note in my garage, and also in your <unk>
Every time I did a scene from the <unk> of my <unk> my teachers <unk>
But I never got a piece of paper.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to make a piece called <unk> <unk> in <unk>
This is a work of a girl with breast cancer.
I was a girl with breast cancer.
So I started screaming at four <unk> when I was going to have a <unk>
I have <unk> <unk>
At the end of the end of the end of the 20th century.
Thanks to God <unk> at least I'm <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  They gave him a <unk>
I was going to go to the head of the police department in the theater, like, historically, if someone had killed my cat, asking why and she told me that because they believed that because they believed that they could do the same things.
And I said, <unk> if I can't do the kinds of risk, I can't get the <unk>
It was a role for which literally had been born and they gave it to a certain way.
I was doing my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> story about <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk>
When I came home, I went home, and my first <unk> was as extra in a <unk>
My dream was what my dream was.
And I knew it would be <unk> to <unk>     <unk> in a <unk>
Instead, it was there as a <unk> I didn't see more than the <unk> and it was obvious for me that the troops were not <unk> <unk> <unk> not <unk>
Just <unk> to people who would love it.
But there were <unk> <unk>
I grew up looking at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had a thing in common: they were <unk>
So I made a <unk>
In my first <unk> I took famous news from New York to New Jersey, and I never forget the face of the first <unk> that took the face of the first <unk> which led to high speed on the <unk> of New York City.
I worked at all of the United States, and also in Arabic in Arabic in the Middle East, with no <unk> and no <unk>
Some people say I'm the first <unk> of the world.
I never like to give you the first place, but I know you have never heard that small <unk> which says that women are not perfect, and they are very <unk>
In 2003, my brother and father, Dean <unk> and I released the <unk> of <unk> <unk> in New York City, now in his <unk> year.
Our goal was to change the negative image of the <unk> in the media media and the time to remind the troops that <unk> and Arabic are not <unk>
And the Arabic was so much easier to fight the challenge of the <unk> of <unk>
My big chance was in Canada in 2010, my big chance came to <unk>
I went as I was a professor at the news of my head of <unk>
And I walked as if it was a dance dance -- I went to a study and sat on a <unk> chair at <unk>
I looked at him and said, <unk> you can give me another <unk>
She looked at me, and he said, <unk> four or three <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I would submit to you at the desk of <unk> to not go back to the screen during the <unk> and when I ended the interview, I was <unk>
At the end I had my opportunity and the <unk> I knew that they didn't get the <unk>
But not only Mr. <unk> he came to <unk> but he was like a <unk> full time and turned my <unk>
One thing that I learned in high school with Keith <unk> was that people in the Internet are <unk>
It says that children are <unk> but they never come out of me and they never forget about it.
Suddenly, my brother in the Internet became <unk>
<unk> <unk> in line with comments like, "Why are you <unk>
"It's <unk>
And my <unk> <unk>
What does a <unk>
We really should be <unk> by <unk>
A <unk> suggested that I would take my brother to my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is as visual as the <unk>
If someone in a chair is not going to be <unk> then you can't make someone in a <unk>
The chimps are the <unk>
The chimps are the most large minority of the world, and the most <unk> in the world of <unk>
The doctors said that not <unk> but I'm here in front of you in front of you in front of you.
However, I had grown with the media media -- I don't think <unk> <unk>
I hope that we can create more complex images of disability in the media and in human life.
Maybe if there were more interesting images that would be more hate in the Internet.
Or maybe no.
Maybe we still need the whole society to teach our kids.
My <unk> my journey has taken me to the very <unk> of the very beginning.
I came to <unk> by the red bar for the <unk> of <unk> Susan <unk> and the famous <unk> <unk> <unk>
I came to act in a movie with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> the incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the world <unk> <unk> have become <unk>
I was <unk> in a big state of New York City in the <unk> of <unk>
And I started <unk> <unk> <unk> an organization to give the children refugees of Palestinians and a <unk> part of what my parents did.
It was the only time that my father saw an act of imagination, and I learned this talk to his own life.
<unk> in peace, <unk>
I call it <unk> <unk> and if I can, you are also <unk> you are also <unk>
I would like to tell you a story about a child from a small village in a small village in a small village in a small village in a small village in a small village in a small village in a small village in a small village in a small village in a small village in a small village in a small village in a small village in a small
I don't know his name, but I know her story.
It lives in a small village in <unk>
This village is near <unk>
The <unk> <unk> in the small village in poverty and the edge of the <unk>
But nothing for him there, it's going to be the big city, in this case, <unk> the capital of <unk>
When it comes there, there are no opportunities, no job, no chance of future.
He was just living in a dead city in the middle of <unk>
After a year -- maybe a year <unk>
One day one day I asked him about a man who gave him a <unk> after she came to visit <unk>
They were going to be a <unk> group of people, which gives you a <unk>
They were a little bit of money for them to make new clothing clothes to send home, to her family.
I put it to a <unk>
They eventually went home.
It starts a new life.
It has a lot of life.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky -- and a little <unk>
That child in that small village with dreams of great city was the <unk> <unk> and that group of people were going to <unk> a foreign organization with the <unk>
So how the story of a child in a small village trying to figure out their dreams in the city ends with him with her dreams on his <unk>
He was a <unk>
I was waiting for an opportunity, waiting for your future, waiting for a perspective, and this was the first thing that I would do.
This was the first thing that took me to what we call <unk> <unk> <unk>
And his story is in urban centers around the world.
This is the story of the <unk> young urban urban urban <unk> which <unk> <unk> in London, who seek something beyond the <unk> of <unk>
By the young people, the promise of the city, the great dream of the city is the basis of the opportunity, but the young people don't know the prosperity of their cities.
It's often the youth who have been the most high rates rates of men.
For 2030, three of five people who live in cities will be less than 18 years old.
If we don't include young people in the growth of our cities, if you don't know why, the story of the <unk> of <unk> the door door of access to violence, will be the story of cities in the United States.
And in my hometown of <unk> <unk> 70 percent.
70 percent of the world don't go to school.
They don't do anything well.
I went to <unk> last month, and I went to visit the <unk> <unk> the hospital where I was born.
I remember to be in that hospital <unk> thinking, and if I could never have <unk>
And if I had to be able to be in that same <unk>
I would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure the answer.
So the reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to make a lot of <unk> in a <unk> way.
They were going to go to about 90 percent.
And we sat down and we had a rain of ideas about the solutions to the great challenges that we have.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He was at the University of <unk>
I didn't work, I didn't work, I didn't know that.
And I remember when he told me that because he was a college -- <unk> <unk> <unk> was the perfect white <unk> for the <unk> and other organizations to be <unk>
They were people like it.
But this story takes a different perspective.
In <unk> the biggest obstacle to the point is to go back to B to B and <unk>
<unk> years of civil war have destroyed completely the road system, and a motorcycle can be the most easy way of <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and <unk> <unk>
He started a company called <unk>
They started to get them to local residents to local residents who usually couldn't <unk>
He bought 10 <unk> with the help of his family and friends, and her dream is at some point to expand hundreds of <unk> over the next three years.
Why is it different -- why is this important?
What does this story look like? What does this mean?
I think their ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
This is the spirit of <unk> and I think the social spirit can be the most powerful tool against <unk>
They were going to be the creators of the economic opportunities that are looking for so much.
And you can train young people to be <unk>
I want to talk to you about a young man who came up with one of my meetings earlier.
I was <unk> to train some of the young people at the top of the business, and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of <unk>
In fact, it's the first <unk> which has seen in more than 22 years, and until a few years ago, until Mohamed asked him, if you wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were <unk>
If you ask someone, "When you remember it was the last time you saw flowers <unk>
For those of you who grew up during the war, the answer would be <unk>
So, Mohamed saw an opportunity.
He started a company called <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I created a farm in <unk> and started to grow <unk> and <unk> that as he said, they could survive the hard climate of <unk>
And he started the flowers of flowers to liberate the homes, and the companies of the city, and now it's working in creating the first public park in 22 years.
There are no public parks in <unk>
It wants to create a space where families, the young families, they can go together, and like he says, <unk> <unk> <unk>
By the way, he doesn't show them because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is to inspire the young people, and in that room, the presence of Mohamed had a really profound impact on the <unk>
They had never thought in the middle of a life.
They had thought to work for a challenge, and to work for government, but their innovation, their innovation, their innovation, actually had a strong impact on them.
They had to look at their city as a place of <unk>
They encouraged them to believe that they could be <unk> they could be <unk> of change.
By the end of the day, they were already innovative solutions, for some of the biggest challenges that we have.
<unk> solutions for financial problems for problems <unk>
So I inspire young people and create a culture of religion -- it's really a great step, but young people need capital to make their ideas happen.
They need experience and strength to <unk> in development and put them in the middle of their minds.
So we were going to get young people with the resources that we need, and the support that we need to go from the creation, and create a <unk> for <unk> <unk>
For me, the public spirit is something else that will start a living, but to me, the social spirit is more than to start a life.
It's creating a social impact of social change.
Mohamed is not simply selling <unk>
I think it's selling <unk>
His <unk> of <unk> so is how it looks like, when it's changing, we transform the way people see their city.
And I hired children from the street to help rent and keep them going.
They gave them the opportunity to escape from the <unk> of <unk>
These young people are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is to become the young people in <unk> <unk> and eat its <unk> innovation -- and you have more stories about flowers and <unk> and <unk> of <unk>
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
I had about 10 years and I went to <unk> with my dad in the mountains of <unk> a <unk> area in New York City.
It was a wonderful day of <unk>
The forest <unk>
So the sun would take the leaves like a <unk> and not to be the way that we were able to use that we were the first human beings in front of this Earth.
We went to our <unk>
It was a <unk> in a <unk> with a beautiful black lake when I discovered something different.
And after the <unk> there was a <unk> of about four meters with <unk> hearts and <unk> balls of <unk>
And I was <unk> I was very happy and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> who were too cold, like to take what they had <unk> who thought she was going to clean their <unk>
That question was, and it was a little bit <unk>
Who <unk> our <unk> our <unk>
No matter how <unk> or where <unk> <unk> who <unk> our garbage in <unk>
Who <unk> our garbage in Rio or in Paris or in Paris or in <unk>
Here in New York City, the Department of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of 11 tons of <unk> and two tons of <unk> every day every day.
I wanted to be able to do it as well.
I wanted to understand who does that work.
What does it mean to use the uniform and take that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and walked through their <unk> and interviewed people in New York City, and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
I needed to get more.
So I started working as a <unk> of <unk>
Now not simply to go in the <unk> I would say <unk> <unk> I <unk>
And <unk> <unk> <unk> and bar <unk> <unk> and <unk>
It was a remarkable thing and an amazing story.
They all ask about <unk>
This is there, but it's not as much as we believe -- and in the days that it is very strong you would be very strong at all.
It costs a lot of <unk>
I met people who had been working on it for several years and their bodies followed by the weight of the body of the body of their body, and all of the <unk>
It's also the <unk>
According to the <unk> Office <unk> the <unk> of waste is one of the ten <unk> <unk> in the country, and I learned the truth.
You're coming up and moving in the traffic all day and you go down to your side.
You just want to be <unk> so in general the driver is not paying attention.
That's very bad for the <unk>
And also the garbage in the <unk> is full of dangers that are often getting out of the walked and <unk> <unk>
I also learned about the <unk> of <unk>
When you go out of <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that garbage is like a force of nature at all.
They never forget about it.
It's also like a <unk> form or <unk>
It always has to be in <unk>
And it's also the <unk>
I would seem to be that stigma is especially important, because I think the <unk> <unk> are the most important hand in the streets of the city, for three reasons.
They are the first fortune of human health, and they're the first <unk>
If you don't look at the <unk> and <unk> and effective and effective every day, this is going to be a <unk> of their <unk> and their dangers are required in different ways in different ways.
You know, we were controlled for decades and centuries back to <unk> and begin to <unk>
The economy is the <unk>
If we can't get rid of the old we don't have space for what the engines of the economy are going to happen when it's in danger of the <unk>
I'm not <unk> by capitalism, I just put her <unk>
And then the thing is what I call our average speed <unk>
And what I mean by the speed is that the speed is to move into the <unk>
You don't have to be <unk> or <unk> or <unk> or we take them with us our coffee cup of coffee, our bag of <unk> our <unk>
So we put them together, we put them back to them, because we know that there is a role force on the other side of it.
So today I want to take you a couple of ways to think about the waste of waste that perhaps help reduce the stigma and <unk> in that conversation about how to design a sustainable city and human life.
His work, I think, is almost <unk>
They are in the street every day, and they're on the streets in <unk>
They use a uniform in many cities.
You know, when you <unk>
And their work allows us to do our own.
It's almost a form of <unk>
The flow of flow of us leaves us from ourselves, of our own <unk> our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow always needs to be a form or another.
A day after September 11, we met the <unk> of a <unk> walked in the street, followed my son and went on the door, and there was a man doing their <unk> <unk> and there was a man doing all the <unk>
And I tried to thank thank you.
And I looked at me and simply <unk> and said, "We were going to be right.
We're going to be <unk>
Just after that, I started looking at the waste of waste and I went to see that <unk>
It's called <unk> we work together many times and we did good friends.
I mean, I would believe that I was right.
We're going to be right.
But in our efforts for <unk> the way we exist in this planet as species we should have to include and have all the costs, even the real human cost of the hand of <unk>
The waste of the <unk> what we think when we talk about <unk> represent the number of waste from the <unk>
This is a <unk> <unk>
So in the flow of your days and of your lives, the next thing you can see someone whose work is to clean the garbage of you, you know, a moment to <unk>
And then a moment to tell you.
My work is focused on the connection of thinking in our community getting part of the environment in the environment, where architecture was born in the developing conditions and traditions, <unk>
Today I'm going to show two research projects like example about this.
Both of these projects are <unk> in countries -- one in Ethiopia and the other in <unk>
In addition to the fact that the different analysis of different analysis from different perspectives become a essential part of the work of science.
The first example started with an invitation to design a commercial center of several stones in the capital of New York City.
This is the kind of building that showed us as a team and a team and to me, about what we needed to learn from.
At the beginning, the first thing I thought was, I want to go back to <unk>
After seeing some of these buildings there are many of these buildings there are many in the city, we realized there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost <unk> because they have very large <unk> where people can't afford the luxury of buying things.
Secondly, you need to use a lot of energy because of the <unk> with ice crystals on the ground, so it's necessary for a long time.
In a city where this shouldn't happen, because it is about 20 to 25 percent of 25 to 25 degrees per year during the entire year.
And thirdly, their aspect doesn't have anything to do with Africa without <unk>
This is a part of a place that is so rich in culture and <unk>
In our first visit in our first visit to Ethiopia, I was really intrigued with the ancient <unk> which is this structure of a thousand people, and buy things every day to little <unk>
This is also that idea of using public space to generate physical activity here.
And so I thought that that was what I really wanted to do, not just a <unk> center for a <unk>
But the thing was how to build a modern building of several <unk> using these <unk>
The next challenge was called the <unk> the site, which is located in a long area of the city, where a lot of the buildings that we now see in the picture, we don't know.
And in addition to the two streets that they don't communicate in a number of days.
So the first thing that we did was to create a connection between these two streets of the building.
And this is a <unk> <unk> which creates a space to the top of the building that <unk> for its own shape, of the sun and the <unk>
And about this space we've put the idea of the market with small plans that changes in each floor because of the shape of the space.
I also thought about how close it was.
I wanted to find a solution that would go to the traditional conditions, right?
And I got to think of a similar tissue, to a small <unk> with <unk> to allow the air signal, and also about the air, but in a <unk> way.
And then we were focused on these beautiful moments of the <unk> of <unk>
They have properties of the fractal geometry and this helped me model the <unk>
We're building that with these little bits that are the windows that they leave up the air, and the light in a way in the building.
So this is <unk> with these small ice crystals that use the light from the building to send the building at night.
With these ideas there are no ideas not enough to convince the issues, because we think it looks like it is not a <unk> <unk>
But ultimately, we all realized that this idea of the market would be much more profitable than the commercial center of the commercial center because of the <unk> there were more <unk>
And in addition to the <unk> of the <unk> it was much more economic because not because of the material compared to it, but it was also because it wasn't necessary to have water.
So we have certain savings in the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first was to think about how to get the <unk> of the building in a city where the electricity would almost almost every day.
So we have a big advantage to put <unk> in the background, and then we put them in the air.
And then under those cells, we think about the roof as a new public space, with areas of <unk> and the <unk> of this <unk>
And these <unk> on the roof, who put water for the back of the building.
They wait for the next year, because we go through the fifth floor of the building.
The second example is a master plan and services in the city of <unk>
And to make a big project so big, the most big thing that I ever heard, I needed not just understanding the city of Ireland but also their environment, their tradition and culture.
During that analysis I got special attention in the <unk> a billion years ago that was surrounded by a wall with a couple of weeks of access required by <unk>
When I went to the place, the first set of design that we did was to expand the streets and create 12 different blocks in the size and characteristics that there are in Barcelona and other cities with these <unk>
In addition to that, we were able to put a few points on the relationship with the idea of the open doors and this <unk> <unk> model.
And the last trial was to think of the cell, the small cell, like the apartment, as a essential part of the plan of the master plan for a very basic problem.
I hope it would be the best part for an apartment in the climate climate change.
And it's <unk> because it creates a heat difference between both sides of the house and so a natural <unk>
So I would put a scheme that would make sure that most of the apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that it is almost as a combination of the European block, and the New York Times.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then in the lower plant, we have all the connections for the <unk>
And it also responds to the local norms that make greater density in the upper levels and less density in the plant in the plant there.
And it's also <unk> this idea of <unk>
On the roof, which is my favorite piece of project is almost as concerned about the community in the universe.
It's where all the neighbors, can go back and get them and make activities such as run a year from two miles a day, or jump from a building to another.
These two examples, have a common approach in the design process.
And also, they're in countries where you can see cities literally coming out of the world.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in the life of people changes the communities and local economies at the same rate that they grow up the same rate that they grow up.
For this reason, I see even more important to the architecture looking for simple solutions, but <unk> which creates the relationship between the community and the environment and the environment and the environment that they have as a goal for people.
Thank you. Thank you.
So when I was eight years old, a new little girl walked into our room and was as <unk> as you see all the new <unk>
He had huge amounts of hair, and a little bit of a little <unk> <unk> was super strong for the Chinese states, very good for <unk>
I ended up that year and I was full of <unk> until I <unk> my <unk>
One day I was a time after the end of school, it was a little afternoon, and I would put them in the bathroom of the <unk>
When the forest was <unk> I walked in the room, I took the table from my head from the <unk> <unk>
And then I did.
And I was interested in my <unk> just a little bit, just a little bit.
All the <unk>  And I asked myself to bring the book to the <unk> but to see, some of my other teammates had very good notes as well.
So in a <unk> <unk> the notes all over the world, without any money to get to the <unk>
I went to all of them, and I would go back to me and I would just be there, because I would be there, because I <unk>
I still realized what I did.
I don't understand how the idea.
I don't understand why I sat right at the right time.
I felt good.
I don't understand why I'm never going to do that.
This is that everything was <unk> obvious that everything was <unk>
I would never forget it.
But about everything, I would argue that the reason I feel like that this <unk> is so good for <unk>
I would be <unk>
They are so <unk> and so <unk>
We know that babies suffer from <unk>
And also the <unk> birds are very <unk>
We know that <unk> are the number one cause of poverty in the United States.
And yet, I've never seen a study that is going to be a study that <unk> or <unk> or <unk>
So you have to go to the fiction, because the lessons are like the laboratory in which we are studying the <unk> in all their possible ways.
In fact, I don't know if it is an exaggeration to say that if you didn't have <unk> <unk> would have no <unk>
So I didn't have <unk> <unk> I didn't have any <unk>
It didn't have the <unk> <unk> or <unk> and a <unk>
I didn't have any <unk>
And I would go out of high school, because we would be missing "The <unk> and the <unk> would not have <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>
In <unk> there are no <unk> I know that it's about <unk> to say that <unk> has the answers for everything, and, in the <unk> of the <unk>
So this year is a hundred years of his work <unk> "If you look at the time -- the most <unk> study of the sexual <unk> and also the <unk> -- everything that we could see.  And thinking about <unk> we have the details, right?
We think in a child trying to get the <unk>
We think in a <unk> <unk> in <unk>
We forget about what that image is.
We forget about what it is.
I mean, this is the books that I had <unk> he said they were as hard as <unk>
I don't know how it's <unk> but we assume that it's <unk>
So let's look at why you are so well together, the novel and <unk> <unk> and <unk>
It will be very obvious as the <unk> that you get to the person, to your wish, to their <unk> are a <unk> narrative problem.
I don't know, I think we get very close to bone, when we think about what happens when we feel <unk>
So when we feel <unk> we have to get to ourselves a story.
A story about the life of other people, and those stories make us feel great, because they're designed for that, to make it feel different.
But despite the time we were born, and audience, we know exactly what to do with the <unk>
The <unk> we are doing all of us, and that is something that we <unk>
All she does for me to give me pleasure to give me pleasure to another, maybe I'm going to give you a sense of it.
And it starts to say, I know that story -- and since then, <unk> says that every item that <unk> it on its own, you can imagine their collection of instruments in their functional <unk>
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were <unk> <unk>
You know, the <unk> of <unk> would have to leave the country, if they wanted to break it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it is a real job, Right? Right?
The <unk> are <unk>
This is a <unk> <unk> There's a <unk>
And how are the <unk>
The <unk> <unk> of information.
The <unk> they use <unk>
And I would like you to do the big <unk> and the big amounts of hair and a little <unk>
The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is why it was so successful --                <unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk>
When <unk> is in their <unk> <unk> they soon hear behind the doors and <unk> the <unk> of their <unk> and then the <unk>
He says, "You know, I know that you think that this is <unk> but it's not different than the interpretation of an old text or a <unk>
He says, "The scientific research with real value <unk>
<unk> is trying to show you that the <unk> you can see -- and you do it -- but in your <unk> they're search of knowledge, and in fact, what is going to be <unk> in fact, what the most important thing is to <unk>
The pain, the <unk> and these were the ones that are going to be <unk>
He says, "The woman who we need to do, we need to engage them in us a lot more than a lot more complicated and vital man that a man who can <unk>
So we're saying that we go to search women <unk>
No. I think it's trying to say that the <unk> allow us to take us to us all.
And there is some other emotion that makes us <unk> from this way as well.
There's some other more emotion we can do with our <unk> our great <unk> and our <unk>
Some other emotion that teaches us to look at the intensity as <unk> as <unk>
Hello. I would write about this more little bit.
One day, Freud was visited by a young man who was able to do with the idea that his woman would do it.
And Freud says that there was a strange thing in that man, which is not a <unk> in which they did their <unk>
So she was <unk> all the world I met at the time.
The poor press was under <unk> without any cause.
But he was looking at things that her wife, not to know whether physical behaviors <unk>
<unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> with a <unk>
Freud says that the man was becoming in the <unk> of his mother.
The teacher are very good at this.
The teacher described very well how the <unk> we were doing with intensity but without the intensity of the intensity of it.
In fact, the more <unk> we are, the more we are, the more we become residents in the physical sciences.
And because of this reason, I think, the <unk> are going to make a war or a <unk>
The <unk> helps us get us to make sure we have a completely different <unk>
Now I'm thinking about my case about eight years ago, but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard in the news.
One woman of the age of 52 years ago was released by having to have a passion in Facebook from which they would send messages to the <unk>
During a year, all a year.
She was trying to <unk> the new girlfriend of his former <unk> I have to tell you that when I or this, I went with <unk>
Because, we will be <unk>
What huge cost, even though we <unk>
It's like <unk>
As a novel <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She is a very strange character character and a brilliant character of the book.
It's the <unk> of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> Mr. <unk> who try to make our minds, and once we are in the sphere, in the kingdom of <unk> the membrane of what it might be, can be <unk> in a way.
So let me show you his character <unk> his character <unk>
Tom <unk> is going to be <unk> or want what you have to do with your self and <unk> what you ever do, and it is under your name, and it's under your name, <unk> your name is <unk>
It's a very complex way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route from Tom <unk>
I can't take you all over the world, so as long as you can see it.
This is a <unk> because we live in the middle of it.
We live in <unk>
So we're good to say, we are good for social networks, where the robot is <unk> right?
The video games show us the <unk> I'm not <unk>
So we're going to do what the characters are always doing when they're not free, when they're going to be a <unk>
Let's go to the <unk> of <unk> Street and ask for <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> you think about <unk> you think about <unk> in Professor <unk> that <unk> <unk>
But I've always been <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the head of <unk> <unk> which needs to be <unk> <unk> needs the <unk> <unk> but he wants to do it.
DL: She sounds like <unk>
They need their help, but they have their help, but they do it, and they <unk> them in every one of the <unk>
But as they work together, something starts to change, and eventually in "The <unk> of the <unk> <unk> once you go back to all with your <unk> <unk> comes to <unk> and says, "We are going to be <unk>
We're proud of <unk>
And he says that there is no person in <unk> <unk> which I don't want to be <unk>
This is one of the few times that we look at <unk> <unk> in history, and it seems like this, that scene is also <unk> right?
It seems to be the <unk> as a <unk> problem with no consciousness.
You know, in a minute, you know, in a minute, you know, in a minute <unk>
At the next minute you're at the same side.
All of all of a sudden, it allows you to explore that idea of being <unk>
It could still be as much <unk>
What happens if the <unk> are actually a design issue just a matter of where we allow us to be in relationship with it.
Well, perhaps we don't have to be the <unk> of the other.
We can do it with it.
But I like the plans for <unk>
So as we hope that as we hope that that happens, we have to remember that we have software for <unk>
It just <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The fiction used to be <unk>
And look at what <unk> <unk> <unk> Tom <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We are in great history.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
We used to solve large problems.
On 21 of July 11, I went back to the <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of 11, 11 and 16.
Armstrong and <unk> were -- but his presence at the top of the ground -- it was the culmination of a collective <unk> process.
The program was the biggest <unk> of peace in the history of the United States.
To get to the <unk> NASA spent about 180 billion dollars, or the four of the budget of the budget of the U.S.
He gave me work to a few <unk> people and asked about 20,000 universities and <unk> universities and U.S. government.
They were going to be <unk> including the <unk>
But before the program called <unk> 24 hours a day.
<unk> <unk> on their surface of which they would go back after the police death last year, it's now the most <unk>
So why would you <unk>
We didn't have a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and something that 24 hours later, a new sense of <unk> and the <unk> of our common common <unk>
Why do you <unk> The answer is, is that it was because the president <unk> wanted to show the <unk> that this nation was better than that.
But the <unk> words at the University of <unk> in <unk> we give us a better idea.
John <unk> And John <unk> Some ask why <unk> <unk>
Why do we make it a <unk>
And they were also asking for what about the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
About 35 years ago, why you fly on the <unk>
Why are <unk>
We can go to the <unk>
We can go to the <unk>
We can go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they are interesting, but because they're hard.
<unk> for the 20th century was not only an victory of the West in the United States in the United States.
At the time, the most strong emotion was <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk>
They were because it was a great power to do this.
The map on the moon occurred in a long context of a long list of time.
The first half of the 20th century was the line line and the airplane, and the vaccine gave us the <unk>
In the middle of the century, it would be <unk> and it was just the <unk> and it was just <unk>
The technology seemed to own what I would call <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Over the most part of the history of humanity, we can't go faster than a <unk> or a ship with these, but in addition to the <unk> of 10 square miles of <unk>
From 1970s, no human being taken to the <unk>
No one has traveled faster than the World Trade Center and <unk> optimism about the power of technology has been able to see that problems that we think that technology is going to be on Mars, to create an energy energy to Mars, to create an <unk>
I remember looking at the <unk>
I was five years old, and my mother told me that I didn't get the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I knew that this would be the last mission -- but I was totally sure that I would be able to see the colonies on Mars.
So that's what happened to our ability to solve problems with <unk> problems that has become a common place in a common place has become a common place.
We hear all the time.
We've heard over the last two days here, at TED.
It looks like the technologists would have <unk> and it would have been released with toys like <unk> applications and social networks, or algorithms that will go <unk> <unk> <unk>
There's nothing wrong in most of these things.
They have <unk> and <unk> our lives.
But not <unk> the big problems of creativity.
What happened?
There's an explanation in Silicon Valley, which is that they have been created for less than <unk> of the years that we <unk> the years of the years that we <unk>
He says that the markets are the <unk> and the incentives are the incentives that the risk of risk <unk>
And he says that the investment of risk caused that <unk> creation of ideas -- by the service of <unk> problems or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is enough to be enough.
<unk> which is going to be bad at <unk>
Even when the risk of risk were in its <unk> point without worry about the risk, it would be a little investments that could go out in 10 years.
The <unk> have always had problems to invest in problems to invest in technology as energy, which need a huge capital and whose development is all over the developing technologies that have ever invested in the developing technologies because they don't have a heart attack.
No, the reason we can't solve the big problems are more complicated and far from the <unk>
Sometimes, we would choose not to solve the big problems.
We could go to Mars if we could get to Mars if we were <unk>
NASA has designed a <unk>
But to go to Mars -- it would be a political decision that was popular and that was never going to happen.
We don't go to Mars because all the world thinks that there are more important things to do on Earth.
Sometimes, we can't solve the big problems because the political systems are going to be <unk>
Today, less than two percent of the energy consumption comes from energy sources like solar energy as solar energy and <unk> percent of the age of two percent, and the reason is completely different.
The coal and gas gas are more active than the solar energy -- and the oil is more cheap than the <unk>
We want to change energy energy sources that can compete in price, not enough.
Now, the entrepreneurs and economists and economists agree about what politics and international international issues -- developing the development of an energy energy -- a significant rise in research and energy, and some kind of control of the price of <unk>
But there are no hope in the current political climate than we will see a global policy policy policy or treated international issues that we have.
Sometimes, the big problems that seemed to be so difficult to find out that they were not enough.
We know from time that liberals are the result of the failure of <unk>
But 30 years of research have taught us that liberals are the policies that affect the distribution of their neighbors -- the distribution of stress.
The technology can improve things like <unk> or the systems for the workforce, but there will be anything like there are bad ones.
And finally, the big problems sometimes <unk> a solution because we don't understand the problem with it.
The president of the British government, the war in Somalia -- but soon we found that there are many types of cancer, some very strong types of treatment, and only in the last 10 years they seem to have found effective treatments and cultural solutions.
The hard problems are hard to be hard.
It's not true that we can't solve problems with technology.
We can do it, but these four elements have to be <unk> political leaders and the population, you should want to solve the problem, the institutions must support the <unk> because it's really a problem, and we have to <unk>
The mission <unk> which has become something like a metaphor for the capacity of technology to solve great problems, understanding with those <unk> <unk>
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There is no competition -- like in the Cold War, there is no politician as John <unk> who <unk> how hard it is. It's not a popular science of science fiction as I explore the solar system.
In general, to go to the moon it turned out to be <unk>
I was going to only three days.
And actually, I didn't even know any problem. No problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be more difficult to get more <unk>
God knows that we don't have to do it.
Thank you. Thank you.
Well, I'm going to talk about the trust, and I'm going to start with you -- the ideas that you have on your mind.
They are so common that they've become <unk> of our society.
I think they're <unk>
The first is a <unk> there's been a huge decline of trust, and it's a very good idea.
The second is a <unk> we should have more <unk>
And the third is a <unk> we should build the <unk>
I think the <unk> the goal and the task has become <unk>
What I'm going to try to tell you today is a different story about a <unk> and a goal, which I think is a more clear idea about the problem.
First of all, why people think that the trust has <unk>
And if I think about the basis of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
I would go to think that it might have come up in some activities or institutions and institutions that might have increased in different ways.
I don't have to do it.
But I can go to the surveys of view, and the surveys of opinion is the source of belief that the confidence has changed.
When you look at the surveys of opinion over the time, there are no evidence of that.
And I mean, the people who are <unk> 20 years ago, mainly journalists and politicians, will be <unk> the same thing.
And the people who were very smart, about 20 years still being pretty <unk>
The rest of us are in the middle, and, by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost exactly the same thing.
But it is this amazing evidence that <unk>
What the surveys of opinion do are, of course, <unk> <unk>
What else can you do?
What you look at are the attitudes that people <unk> when they get certain questions.
<unk> in <unk> <unk> in <unk>
Now, if someone asked you to <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in <unk>
<unk> in the teachers of <unk>
You probably have to ask them to ask them questions.
And that would be a very difficult question.
And you might say, when you have <unk> your question, "Well, I have to be in a certain way.
What is very important.
In fact, in real life, we tend to get the confidence in the way.
We didn't think that the level of confidence that we are going to feel like a certain type of <unk> or <unk> or kind of the person, it's going to be <unk>
I could, for example, to say that I was in a certain community that I know to give the class class but in any way to lead the <unk>
After all, I would know that it wasn't a good thing.
I could trust my friend more <unk> to keep a conversation, but no, maybe to save a <unk>
<unk>
And if we have those evidence in our collective lives in the way that trust is <unk> why do we stop the whole knowledge when we think of all that knowledge in more <unk>
I think surveys are very bad tools to measure the real level of real confidence because they're trying to <unk> the good judgment of the fact that we have to rely on something or in it.
Secondly, what happens with the <unk>
The goal is to have more <unk>
Frankly, I think it's a goal, but it's an opportunity.
It's not that the goal that I would <unk>
I would say to you to have more confidence where it is <unk> but not what it does not mean to do it.
In fact, I'm <unk> of not trust where it's not <unk>
And I think those people who are doing their savings with the very <unk> he called Mr. <unk> who then disappeared with them, and I think, well, yes, they were too <unk>
To make more confidence it's a smart goal in this life.
<unk> <unk> or <unk> -- that is the goal right now.
Once you say, I said, yes, that means that what it means in the first place is not the trust, but the <unk>
So what it is about to do is to make a judgment of how fast people are in different ways.
And I think to be able to make a trial, we are forced to focus on three things: <unk> <unk>
They're <unk> they're <unk> they're <unk> they're <unk>
And if we find that a person is <unk> in the <unk> and it's responsible and <unk> then we will have a very good reason to rely on it, because it's going to be <unk>
But if the other thing is not, we can't rely on them, we can't trust them.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest, but not <unk> but not <unk> in them to take a letter to him, because they're <unk>
I have friends who are very sure that they're very sure that they can do certain things, but I see them <unk> their own <unk>
And I'm happy to say that I think I think I don't have a lot of friends that are <unk> and responsible for it.
If it is so much, I still don't know.
But that is what we're going to do, before I talk to you earlier that I'm going to talk about that.
The confidence is the answer.
The <unk> is what we have to do.
And of course, it's hard.
In the last decades, we've been trying to build <unk> systems for all kinds of financial institutions, and other kinds of animals, and so they do more easy job, the task to judge their <unk>
Many of those systems have had the exact opposite.
They don't work as well.
I remember once I was talking with a <unk> and said, "Well, you can see the problem is that it takes more time to do the <unk> <unk> which would go on the <unk>
And we find the same problem in all of our public lives, and we need that the system of <unk> which is meant to guarantee that we can guarantee that we can guarantee that we can actually do the opposite.
What they do is <unk> the work of the people who have to do hard tasks like <unk> <unk> which <unk> the <unk> like <unk>
So you all know that you all know some of these things.
And I would put it all out of it.
I think the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if we were willing to be willing to be <unk> and <unk> to people that we were safe and if they were willing to determine whether other people, or politicians are <unk>
It's not easy, it's the case -- it's <unk> <unk> which is the <unk> which is not going to happen.
The third place, the <unk>
<unk> to the task to reconstruct the trust, puts the things to the other.
It suggests that you and I should rebuild the <unk>
Well, we can do it with us, and we can do it with us.
We can reconstruct a little bit <unk>
We can do it if we are two people, and we try to improve the world.
But the trust, the trust, is to take it to the other side.
You can't reconstruct what other people have seen before.
You have to give them the same, enough for them to rely on you.
You have to be <unk>
And that, of course, it is because of course, it's because you can't <unk> for all people all the time.
But you also have to take <unk> tests that are worthy of <unk>
How do you do it.
So that's a lot of time in all of them, which makes poor people, the <unk> the <unk> the <unk>
I'll give you a simple example of this.
The store where I bought my <unk> says that I can make a <unk>
And I've got to give them money, or help me help me change the color of the color that I <unk>
This is amazing, <unk> in them because they were forced by me.
I think there's a great lesson on that.
If you get vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good proof that you're dependent on confidence and you have confidence in what you're doing.
So in the end, I think that what we're aiming at, it's not a very difficult thing.
So what people trust is in relationships, and in that way, they can determine when and how the other person is <unk>
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
From the early computers we have been able to reduce the separation between us and the digital data, the digital data, the <unk> of our material world and the world of the screen where the imagination can be <unk>
This is what it has been <unk> every time and more and more than one of the reasons it is at least one of one Laptop per square -- and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone.
But I ask and if I didn't have <unk>
I started imagining how it works.
So first I created this tool that would go into the digital space, so when the strong <unk> on the screen on the screen is going to be <unk>
So designers can <unk> their ideas directly into 3D communication, and surgeons can focus on virtual organs below the screen.
So with this tool that we put in the <unk>
But the two hands are still out of the screen.
So how do you get inside and interact with the digital information using all the <unk>
In the <unk>
So you can imagine a transparent <unk> with a place to detect your toes and face, you can now get the hands of the shape of a 3D space, and put it directly with your hands.
As the windows and the files have a location in real space, <unk> is so easy to put a book from a <unk>
And you can see the book and the <unk> and the words with the virtual neural sensor that you have on every screen <unk>
Now, the architects can be able to rotate their models directly with their hands.
In these examples, we <unk> in the digital world.
And if we invest the papers and we do the digital data, it comes to us.
And so many of us would have bought and put things on the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to be that it doesn't have to happen.
So what I have here is a virtual <unk> by the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a device called <unk> or <unk> when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we take this idea further, I thought, rather than just looking at things in space, how we can do it as a physical way that we can <unk> and <unk>
So how would it be a future there?
And at the MIT Media Lab with my <unk> <unk> <unk> and my collaborator, <unk> We created this kind of physical thinking.
This <unk> <unk> is like a <unk> in 3D 3D, which means that the computer as computer users, can move to any place within this small space of this small space.
And so what we did was we took the gravity and control the movement through a combination of <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And in order to program the object, put it out of the constraints of time and space, what it means to say that human beings can <unk> and go back to <unk> and get to <unk>
You can teach <unk> <unk> and <unk> and famous about Michael <unk> from Michael <unk> you can reproduce as a physical reality that <unk>
The students can use it as a tool to understand concepts like the <unk> of the planets, and, unlike the <unk> or the books, this is a real experience and a real experience that you can play and <unk>
But what's more fascinating to change the physical part of the computer is imagine how to program the world is going to change our physical media.
As you see, the digital data, not just to show you something but we will start to act directly about us as part of the physical world that surrounds us with our world.
We started talking about a talk today about one thing, but if we could, the only limit that is left is our <unk>
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
I would be <unk> to become <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the years of <unk>
When I was in the first grade, the government wanted to go to a school for all the <unk>
But my mother said, "What?"
My parents wanted me to become engineering as them, like them.
Then then we survive the Industrial Revolution to create convinced that there were only one way to deal with the <unk> a certain work and <unk>
No matter whether the work would like or not.
But my dream was to be an artist.
This was me, in my piano <unk>
One of my surgery has to start with <unk> from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to the <unk> of <unk>
And so I wrote the director of the school and at the University of New York.
But any adult <unk> the idea.
No family took me in a very short <unk>
I just had my friends -- but they were kids, but they were kids, as I was talking about.
So it was the age of 15 years ago, I knew that it was too big for me.
My dream was never <unk>
And so during the rest of my life a second story was the only thing that I could ever imagine.
And this was so sweet.
So I decided to look at another <unk>
No one of my things about <unk>
<unk> to the books.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> I came to the United States in 1995, and what were the first books that I left on.
The ones that were <unk> in China, by course.
"The <unk> <unk> this is the <unk>
And it's not the <unk>
The Bible is interesting, but it looks like this.
That's a topic for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a <unk> of your father and the <unk>
<unk> I would say, "It's so different, and much better than <unk>
So it became my tool to go out of this idea of empathy, and to make sure the relationship with my parents' lives.
The rest with a new culture also gave me a place of reading <unk>
<unk> a lot of <unk>
For example, at the beginning this map, this map came out of place because this is what students in China did.
I didn't know that China didn't have to be in the middle of the world.
A map means the perspective of people.
<unk> <unk> is not something new.
It's a common form in the world.
There are all of these research fields as well as religion and literature <unk>
<unk> and <unk> and <unk> gave them a more profound understanding of a problem.
And I thought that if you read a lot of fun, why don't you also do it in your life.
So I started reading books from one of the <unk> books of <unk>
They can be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of David <unk> who were involved in a <unk> <unk> or friends with <unk>
For the <unk> the <unk> are <unk> politics and <unk>
For the <unk> they are all <unk> It's all <unk>
If you know another language, it's also fun to read your favorite books, in two things.
<unk> <unk> Thomas <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> At the end of the day, I found out that you can get a lot of them from it.
For example, it's through the translation that I realized in Chinese Chinese literally means <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese <unk> literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And the books were opened up to me with a magic door to <unk> with people from the past and <unk>
I know that I don't go back to feel used or <unk>
To be a dream -- it's not anything compared with what many other people have <unk>
I have come to believe that <unk> is not the only purpose of a <unk>
Its most important purpose is to connect with the place that come to dreams, where the passion, where the passion, where it comes from.
Until a dream -- you can do that for you.
And it's because of books, that today I'm here, happy, living together with purpose and understanding most of the time.
So the books, the books, the books are always <unk>
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Thanks  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first client of <unk>
And I was a graduate student at the clinic in 2004.
She was a <unk> woman called <unk> <unk>
Alex came to the first session with the first session -- and a <unk> I went back in the face of my office and told me that I wanted to talk about their problems with men.
And when I heard this, I sat down so <unk>
My grandmother had a <unk> like the first one.
And I asked me a <unk> I wanted to talk about them.
I thought that I could do it.
But I didn't do it.
With the <unk> stories that Alex put to the <unk> it made me easy to move my head while I was <unk>
"The <unk> are the new <unk> <unk> and why I see what I do, she was right.
So you start to work after that, and then you have children after death goes out.
For <unk> like Alex and I had time to get out of it.
But shortly after my talk, my <unk> gave me to Alex who talk about Alex who talk about his life.
I would <unk>
I said, "This is coming up with guys under the middle of his state, but it's not as if it was going to be a <unk>
And so my name is he said, "No, no, but maybe it was a <unk>
And also, the best time to work in marriage marriage is before it comes to <unk>
This is what psychologists call a moment to <unk>
It was when I realized that the <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yes, people sit head after what they do, but this was not made that the <unk> of Alex would be a pause in their <unk>
This made the <unk> of Alex to the perfect moment and we were going to be <unk>
So I realized that this kind of <unk> was a real problem, and I had real implications not only for Alex and his life -- but for breast cancer and the future of all of the <unk>
There are 50 million <unk> in the United States today today.
This means 10 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you consider that nobody gets to the moon, without the <unk>
Raise your hand if you're in your <unk>
I want to look at the <unk>
Oh, you know, they're <unk>
If you work with <unk> love to a <unk> I want you to be a <unk> I want to see. It's fine. It's good.
This is not just my <unk> These are the facts. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will go to the 35 years.
This means that eight of every 10 decisions and experiences and moments that give you shape your life will be spent for when you have 30 and <unk>
One of the <unk> people of <unk> not <unk>
This public is going to be good, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a race has an exponential impact on the amount of money that we have.
We know that more than half of Americans are willing to live or they're coming up with their future partner to the 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up and the last stage of growth in their <unk> and it comes to the <unk> which means that if there is something that you want to change itself, now is the moment for you.
We know that the personality changes more times during their <unk> that at any other time of life, and we know that the man gets to the top of the <unk> and things become complicated to the <unk>
The <unk> are the moment to <unk> about his body and their friends.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years are important for language and <unk> in the brain.
It's a moment in which their own life and common has a <unk> impact on the person who is <unk> in the person who <unk>
But what we don't hear is that there's something called the adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in the developing world.
But this is not what the <unk> are.
The girls talk about changes in the time of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The researchers call the <unk> a <unk>
The journalists would put their names at the <unk> <unk> and <unk>
It's true. It's true.
As a culture, we have considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines the <unk>
<unk> said that to get great things, you need a plan and not enough time.
It's not enough.
What do you think happens when you give it to a <unk> in your head and say, <unk> another 10 years to start your <unk>
It doesn't happen.
And he told that person the sense of <unk> and his ambition is not about anything.
And then all of the days, amazing intelligent, interesting intelligent, like you or daughters come to my office and say something like this: "I know that my mom is not good for me, but this relationship is not just <unk>
Or they say they say that as we start a career before we start a career before the time, everything will be <unk>
But then it starts to sound like this: <unk> <unk> are by <unk> and I still don't have anything to do.
It was better than the day I graduated from <unk>
And then it starts to sound something like this: I want to talk about the <unk> were like the game of <unk>
They all saw it, but then at some time about the past, and they were going into music and they all started <unk>
I didn't want to be the only thing to be <unk> so I sometimes think I loved my husband because he was the fastest chair when he had <unk>
Where are the <unk>
I don't do that.
Well, it sounds a little bit big, but not the risks are very important.
When you leave a lot of things for the <unk> there's a huge pressure on the phone, and so many of you will start a country, pick a city and have two or three children in a long period of time.
Many of these things are not <unk> and there's research that we start to show you that it's much more difficult and you can do all of the <unk>
The crisis of <unk> age -- it's not about buying cars or <unk>
This is what it looks like you can't have the career that you want now.
I realized that you can't have the son you want to know now, or you can't give a lawyer to your child, or you can't get a lawyer to your mother.
A lot of <unk> and <unk> you see themselves, and to me, sitting in the room, and talk about their <unk> I know about their <unk>
I want to change what the <unk> are doing and thinking, but I want to change what the <unk> are.
Here is a story about how it might be.
It's a story about a woman called <unk> <unk> <unk>
On the 25, he came up with my office because he was, in their own words, having a <unk> crisis in <unk>
He said, "I would like to work in art, or in the respect, but I still can't tell you, so I spent the last years working as a <unk>
As it was more cheap -- she lived with a <unk> who showed more <unk> than a <unk>
And despite being a very difficult <unk> his life before he had been even more important.
<unk> often in our <unk> but then you get to the same as I say, "You don't eat your family, but you can pick their <unk>
Well, one day he got his head on his legs and he recognized for almost all the <unk>
I had just to buy a new book for <unk> and I had spent the entire morning in the morning -- and then I was looking at the space room that was still after the words of the words of emergency case <unk>
I was at the point of <unk> when I saw him and said, "It's going to be for me if I have a <unk>
Who is going to give me care if I'm going to give you a care of me?
At that time, I had a lot of work -- and I don't say <unk> <unk> <unk>
So what I'm going to talk about was not a <unk> which was really <unk> that it was <unk>
She needed a better life and I knew that this was his opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex as to just sit on Alex as a decade ago.
So during the next few weeks and months, I told him about three things that all <unk> man or said, "You know, I know I know.
First of all, I told him that the <unk> of the identity of the identity of your identity and <unk>
So by your identity I mean to make something that you put value to your person.
To say something that is an investment in which they want to be a <unk>
I didn't know the future of <unk> and nobody knows the future of work, but I know that the quality of identity has to be <unk>
So now it's the moment for that work on the other side of the country, from that company who want to be <unk>
I'm not going to show you the exploration -- I'm going to explore the exploration that I shouldn't say that, because by the way, it's not <unk>
<unk> is <unk>
And I said to me that <unk> work and they do it.
Secondly, I told him that the urban tribes are <unk> they're <unk>
The best friends are great for us to take to the airport, but the ones that we put with friends with minds with minds like who know what you think about, how do you think about, how do you think about that?
That new piece of law, that new person who was going to go back almost always comes out of its more <unk>
So the new things come from what you call the weak friends of your friends.
Yes, half of them have a bad job or they don't have work.
But the other half not, and the weak figures are the way of doing this group.
Half of the work created never <unk> so to know the head of your neighbor is the way to get a job to get a work out.
It's not to do it. It's the science of how the information comes from.
In the last time but not less importantly, he believed that you don't eat their family, but I know her friends.
This was true when I was growing but as a <unk> he came back to his family when she has a partner and improved his own family.
I said to me that the time to pick her family had come up to pick her family at <unk>
Maybe you think the 30 is best to sit head head out that 20 or even 25 and even the 25 and I am from you.
But you pick the person with the person who live now or you <unk> now when everybody in Facebook started to walk into the <unk>
The best time to work in your marriage is before I do it, and that means to be as part of the love as you're at the work.
And so your family should be a conscious choice of who and what is what they want instead of doing to work or kill a time with who would be that <unk>
So what happened with <unk>
Well, we went back to that <unk> and she found the <unk> <unk> which was working in a museum of art in another way.
This weak link helped get a work there.
And that supply of work gave me a reason to leave it to the <unk> with which I would go to the <unk>
Now, five years later, it's <unk> special of events in between.
This kid with a man who invented the <unk>
It was a new career, and his new family, and I would put a letter that said, "Now the spaces of emergency rooms are not good enough.
The story of mine can sound easy, but that's what I love about working with <unk>
It's very easy to see.
The <unk> are like the ones that come out of the evening of Los Angeles, which come back to some place in the United States.
Just before the <unk> a little bit away from their trajectory makes the difference between land in Alaska or in <unk>
In the same way, about 21 or 25 percent of the <unk> and even the <unk> a good job, a good TED Talk, can have huge effects in the next few years or even in the future.
So here this was my <unk> idea of all the cartoons that I would <unk>
It's as simple as what I learned to tell you.
This is what I now have the privilege of telling <unk> as <unk> all the <unk> the <unk> <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
They don't know why they don't know what they did or what they didn't do or they didn't do it.
They are doing their life today.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very <unk> work in <unk> <unk> for a work that was even more <unk>
I was going to show you mathematics to graduate students, in the public schools of New York City.
And as any teacher, I would take tests and <unk>
I gave them <unk>
And when the work comes in, the <unk> <unk> the <unk>
And what I called the attention was that the <unk> was not the only difference between my best friends and my worst students lived there.
Some of the people who had a better performance rate didn't have any <unk>
So some of my most smart kids weren't going to be so good.
And that made me think about it.
And the kind of things that they need to learn in math is in math grade, sure, they are <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts are not too much and I was very convinced that every one of my students could learn the lesson if they were working hard and during the time.
And after several years more than <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of the students and learning from a <unk> perspective, from a different perspective.
In education, the only thing we know about how to measure the best way to measure the best way to do better things.
This is the <unk> but what happens if you have success in school and in life depends on much more than the ability to learn how to make a quick <unk>
So I left the classroom and I went to college to become <unk>
I started studying children and adults in all sorts of scenarios -- and in every study my question was, who has success here and why?
My research team and I went to the National Academy of <unk> West <unk>
We tried to compare what <unk> <unk> in medical training and who would be <unk>
We went to the <unk> National <unk> and we tried to compare what children would do, the most possible thing in <unk>
We talked to teachers <unk> working in neighborhoods very hard to do what teachers still will be teaching for the end of the year of the year and the <unk> who will be the most effective outcomes of their <unk>
We teamed up with medical companies asking which of these sellers to keep their head out of it.
And who is going to make more <unk>
In all these societies, a lot of different contexts emerged a bit more important than a important success.
And it wasn't the social intelligence of innovation.
It wasn't the good luck -- the physical health, and it wasn't the <unk>
It was the <unk>
So what is hard to do is to focus on a very long period of time.
<unk> is a <unk>
The determination is to ask their future, day after day, not only for the month, but for years and working working really hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> is to live life as if it was a <unk> not a career for all of you.
A few years ago, I started to study the determination in public schools in New York.
I asked thousands of hours of high school who would put my hands out and then sat around a year for a year to see who was <unk>
It turns out that children with more determination had significantly greater less likely to be more likely to be <unk> even when <unk> in every single thing that I could measure, things like your family <unk> even security results when they were at school.
So it's not only in West factories or in the <unk> <unk> in which the <unk> also is in school, especially for children in the <unk>
For me, the most shocking thing about <unk> is the thing that we know -- the science of their physical development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How does it development in the <unk>
What I need to do for the children is to teach the children a lot of work as well.
How do you take <unk> for the long <unk>
The most honest answer is, I don't know.  What I know is that talent is not enough.
Our data show you very clearly that there are a lot of individuals who are simply not going forward with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, the <unk> <unk> is not going to be used or it's even better for the <unk> <unk>
So far, the best idea that I've heard about develop the logic in the children is something called <unk> <unk>
This is an idea developed in the University of Stanford, by Carol <unk> and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not the ability to learn not to change it.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when children read and learn about the brain and how it changes in response to the challenge, they're much more likely to be more likely to be <unk> when they <unk> because they don't believe that they have a <unk>
So the growth of growth is a great idea to develop <unk> <unk>
But we need more. But we need more.
And there is where to end my speech, because there is where we are.
That's the work that we have for granted.
We need to take our best ideas, our biggest <unk> and we need <unk> <unk> and we need <unk>
We need to measure whether they have been successful and we have to be willing to be willing to be willing to get all of our new lessons with the lessons we need.
In other words, we need to be sure about making our children more <unk>
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
And I would argue that the daughter of a <unk> one of my most <unk> memories is my mother <unk> beauty, the beauty, the beauty and the shape of the <unk>
From that time, I would say to me for this very incredible language of this.
But for a while, it seems to be as <unk> as the Great <unk> China.
In the last few years, I've been asking if I can make this <unk> so that I want to understand the beauty of this sophisticated language, it can do it.
I started thinking about how a new method and fast to learn Chinese might be useful as possible.
Since I was five years old, I started to learn how to draw every one of the fruits of each <unk> on the right sequence at the right time.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Because we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a smaller way, and it would be a little bit better.
A Chinese <unk> 20 thousand <unk>
You just need a billion to understand the <unk>
The first 200 will allow us to understand 40 percent of the basic literature, enough to read <unk> <unk> <unk> to understand the basic idea of the pages of pages or <unk>
Now today today with eight to show you how it works.
They're <unk>
So their mouth is as much as it would be possible until it would be <unk>
I'll give you.
This is a person who is going to take a look.
<unk> <unk>
If the shape of the fire is a man with his arms in both sides, as if I were to get <unk> <unk> I am <unk> this symbol is actually <unk> in the way of saying, but I like to believe that it's the other way.
This is a <unk>
tree tree.
This is a <unk>
Next <unk>
The <unk>
The symbol of the door seems to a couple of weeks ago in the old country.
<unk> about these eight <unk>
They're building blocks of building blocks of building a lot more <unk>
A person.
If someone comes back, that's <unk>
And as the old man said, the old he says two are <unk> three are <unk>
If a person in the middle of your eye, this person is saying <unk> so <unk>
The person in the mouth, is <unk>
This is a <unk> as a <unk> within the <unk>
A tree is a tree, and a tree is a <unk>
Three trees together, we also have the <unk>
Look at a table under the tree, and we have the <unk>
So a mouth about the tree, which is a <unk>   -- you know, one tree is pretty <unk>
Remember the <unk>
Two thirds together, it makes a lot of <unk>
Three <unk> together, that's a lot of <unk>
Look at them under the two trees, that is <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of <unk>
Two <unk> together, <unk> <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Look at the sun and the <unk> and the <unk> and it is the <unk>
It also means morning, after one day and a night.
The sun goes on the <unk>
So a little <unk> on the side of the door, it's the <unk>
Look at a mouth in the door, ask questions.
<unk> there is someone in the <unk>
This person is coming from a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a <unk>
Two women are <unk>
Three women have care is <unk>
So we've already spent for almost 30 years.
When you use this example, the first eight <unk> will allow us to build <unk>
The next group of eight characters building the next <unk>
So in every small school, they will be able to learn a couple of other ways that is the same thing that learns a Chinese Chinese Chinese <unk>
So after the first time, we started to create <unk>
For example, the mountain and the fire together, we have a little <unk> It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the land of the Sun <unk>
This is a sun put on the pyramid, because Japan is at the end of China.
So a sun next to the beginning, we created Japan.
One person behind Japan, which is the <unk>
One person is a <unk>
The character on the left are two mountains and one on the other.
In the ancient China, that meant in <unk> because the Chinese Chinese Chinese <unk> to their politicians are beyond the <unk>
Today, the <unk> has become <unk>
So a mouth that tells you where to go back is a <unk>
This is a slide to remind you that I have to leave you and go back to the second. Thank you. Thank you.
What I would like to be my dad are the films that I have to see.
I love to share my films about my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, we saw the <unk> <unk>
And the movie, his imagination for months.
His favorite character was <unk> by course.
And he gave a good fortune to use a brilliant <unk> and take a real <unk>
But when you see that movie, so many times, you get to understand that it's <unk>
Now we live and we get our children in a kind of complex complex of <unk> and they will be able to pay attention.
However, <unk> <unk> was an event at the same time.
I didn't see that <unk>
So the trend actually took us back years later with, interestingly, the other movie, whose <unk> a metal <unk> and a <unk> <unk> <unk> to a young girl as a <unk>
You know what I'm saying.
There's a huge difference between these two films, there are a couple of big differences between the <unk> and all the films that we see today.
One is that there are very long violence violence in <unk>
The monkeys are pretty <unk> as <unk>
But I think if the <unk> <unk> would be able to do today, the <unk> would say, <unk> are the <unk> <unk> like the <unk>
Do you use <unk> <unk> to go to the <unk>
But that is not what happens to me.
So another one thing about <unk> is that the most <unk> characters and even <unk> are women.
I started to notice that when I did a German Health Times, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that time, he had a son who had a son son at the time.
Thank you.
He wasn't invited to the <unk> because he was very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the <unk> level there was <unk>                     I was impressed as a victim of foot with his <unk> and I didn't think he was going to do it.
I wonder what <unk> <unk>
We know that the <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And the sense that she gets to a military is a military for <unk>
<unk> this with the <unk> of <unk>
How does it go?
In doing good <unk> with all and being a <unk>
This is the kind of world where I want my children to be able to get out of it, and not a world of men who <unk> which is where they're going.
Why are there so many physical strength force on the films for our children, and so soon the way of <unk> <unk>
There are a lot of literature about the impact of the films of male medical films in the girls, and they should <unk> it's very good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this <unk>
I know that the experience that <unk> <unk> doesn't lead to the appropriate framework that I would have used to navigate the world in the world that is <unk>  I think at the end of the first decade I really hoped that they were the end of the movie, right?
My search has come up, I have <unk>
Why are you going to go back to <unk>
I don't know what I do.
The films are focused on <unk> and getting their smell, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like being a child, you have to be an <unk> animal and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk> <unk>
There's a lot of exceptions, and to defend the <unk> of <unk> to any of you.
But they send a message to the kids, even though they know them, they're not really their <unk>
They do a great job to teach girls how to protect the <unk> but not necessarily show the kids how to protect the <unk>
There's no model for them.
We also have a lot of great women who write new stories for our children, as real as <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being films of war.
Of course, the most successful topic of all the time is going on in classic <unk> every one of them about a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and her son, or two men who are <unk>
So as a lot of you are thinking, this year, eventually came out of <unk> <unk>
The thing about all of you today is available in <unk>
Remember that the critical thing when it came to <unk>
I can't believe that we would have done a movie of a <unk>
It's very good, not let that <unk>
Well, almost no one of these films about <unk> <unk> <unk>
I don't know if you've heard about this.
And it's not just the roots and it's already <unk> but perhaps we start to start a piece of paper.
<unk> <unk> <unk> is a book, and in the late 1980s, I recorded a conversation that had been with a friend of the films that would be <unk>
And it's very simple -- there's only three questions that you should <unk> In the movie, there's more than a female character who has <unk>
So there are so many <unk>
These women are talking to each other at some point of view.
Their conversations are about something else from the guy who has so much <unk>   Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you. Thank you.
Two women who exist and talk about things like this.
So I seen, and yet I think very much about what I see in the video that we know and <unk>
In fact, this week I went to see a very good <unk> <unk> <unk>
Right? <unk> <unk> success success of what a movie of a Hollywood movie is a movie of <unk>
<unk> not about the test of <unk>
And I don't think we should be <unk> because a lot of the movie, I don't know if you've seen, a lot of the movie in a <unk> where men and women are killed during the <unk>
We have a lot of pictures of men who have deep conversations and fast in this <unk> and it's the great moment for one of the <unk> to get a look at the door and say, <unk> in bed, <unk>
This is <unk>
So we were in the numbers.
In 2011, the 100 films that are most popular films of them believe they have <unk> <unk>
<unk> It's not enough.
It's not the same percentage that the number of women that we've chosen recently for Congress, then it's fine.
But there's a number greater number that this is going to be a <unk> this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done before.
This is what I said, this is what I said, this is what it looks like.
In the United States, one of every five women says that it has been <unk> once in his life.
I don't think whether it's the lack of cultural <unk>
I don't think the films for children have something to do with that.
I don't think the videos of music or conservatives are closely <unk> but something wrong -- and when I hear that story, one of the things that I think is a huge amount of <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are these <unk>
What does it do <unk>
They are <unk> the story that says that the role of a male teacher is getting to the <unk> with violence against violence and then <unk> the matter which is a woman who doesn't have friends and not <unk>
We are <unk> that <unk>
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing, we find this world and this statistic very <unk> and we want to <unk>
We have tools like <unk> <unk> and hope that that <unk> but I have to say <unk> <unk> is going to be <unk> if at the same time, it hits our children to our children so that they will keep their <unk>
I mean, I think the list of <unk> is a way of doing something really important, and here I mean because of the kids.
I think we need to show our kids a new definition of <unk> <unk> a new definition of <unk>
The definition of <unk> is changing <unk>
I read about how the new economy is changing the role of the home of the home and the <unk>
It's all changing. It's all changing.
And when I asked my daughter what his favorite character called <unk> <unk> you know, what you would <unk>
<unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What do you have in common these <unk>
Perhaps it's not just the <unk>
I think they're <unk>
I think these are the two people in those films that you know more than anything, and I love to share your knowledge with other people for other people to get their <unk>
They are <unk>
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my child, and I like that kind of stories for my mother.
I want more stories like this.
I want to give you less stories where I tell my <unk> <unk> and struggle only and most of my work that their work is to join a team -- perhaps a team has been to help other people to improve and be better people, like <unk>
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
And a little girl, he lived in Burkina and one of the things that I was like, I was looking for al Qaeda on the coast of Virginia, because my parents told me that I would give you a little bit about it.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They are covered in sand and it's hard to do this.
However, the time, I would go back to <unk>
I started looking at ways and patterns that helped me <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in a love for the past and <unk>
And finally when I started studying <unk> I realized that to see my own eyes were not enough.
Because, anyway, in Egypt, my little beach in Burkina had grown up to one of the almost 40 miles of length along the <unk>
And my fortune Diego had grown the size of cities.
This is really what I took to you to use pictures of <unk>
To try to do a map of the past, I knew that I had to see another way.
I want to show you a example of how different we see the <unk>
This is a place called the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>
And the place, a simple view, seems to be dangerous, but when we use the <unk> and we can actually use it in color in yellow -- the place you see as <unk>
What you're looking at are the real changes of the landscape, caused by building materials and the ancient activities of the ancient <unk>
I want to share with you how we have used the data to find a <unk> city, called <unk> <unk> for thousands of years.
<unk> was the capital of the ancient Egypt for over 400 years ago in a period of time called the Middle World
The place is in <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the '90s, there were this great <unk> of old art, the architecture and the <unk>
The <unk> always have known that they would have known that <unk> was in some place near the top of the two kings that <unk> <unk> within the red circles here, but somewhere within this huge <unk> of <unk>
This area is huge about <unk> by <unk>
Before, <unk> <unk> right next to the side of <unk> and as it changed with the time, it came to this and built the entire city.
So how to find a city <unk> in a <unk> landscape, <unk> <unk>
And I think it would be the equivalent of the equivalent of a needle in a <unk> with the eyes of <unk> and using <unk>
So we use data from NASA to make a map of the place, with very large changes in very different ways.
We were able to see where the <unk> <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting -- this area is a very complex area here, that we think it might be the location of <unk>
So we learned with scientists doing the work of <unk> you can see here.
And when I say <unk> is like the sound of shows on ice, but in place of the climate change we look forward from the future.
Five meters down, below one layer of <unk> we find a dense layer of <unk> objects of <unk>
This means that in this possible location of <unk> five meters down, we have a layer of several hundred years of the Ottoman Empire -- exactly the same period that we think is <unk>
We also found out <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> which shows what it shows you there was a <unk>
This might seem to be a lot, but when we think about the <unk> stones in the <unk> of the Ottoman Empire -- these are the stones that are <unk>
So we have a dense layer of <unk> which comes from the Middle East in this place.
We also have evidence of a baseball workshop that shows that what has been there, it was a very important city.
Even we don't find <unk> here, but <unk> the place in a lower future for <unk>
And even more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of artificial technology so that they can also make big <unk>
I want to end with my favorite quote from the Ottoman Empire -- probably he was born in <unk> 60 years ago.
The knowledge is the biggest of all <unk>
There's nothing like that in the air.
So according to TED -- I didn't have it in <unk> <unk> <unk>
And so the ideas were really started in <unk> <unk> in a <unk> city, not for a long time and later on.
And I certainly put the search of <unk> in perspective.
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
I want to tell you that my eyes.
Imagine standing on the door of <unk> home.
I'd like to give you attention to the color of the door, the material that's <unk>
Now <unk> a group of <unk> <unk> in <unk>
They are <unk> in a race and they go into a baseball race and they go on their door door to their <unk>
I need to look at this <unk>
They're <unk> they're <unk> they're <unk> they're <unk>
And they stopped in front of the door of their home.
There are farms flying across all of them, which they go on to their side, the <unk> that end up in places like <unk> <unk> the threshold of the door, <unk>
By the way, at the bottom, or what you see on the other side of the door, and look at the quality of the light.
The <unk> in your hand is <unk>
From his chair on a horse for a <unk>
It's a horse that <unk>
You can feel your <unk> blue <unk> on your head.
You can smell the <unk> <unk> and you get to the point of getting into your mouth, on your head.
It was a side of one side and run out of his room in the <unk>
Already in the room, and making use use of their imagination, imagine <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is a little bit of clothes, dancing about his <unk> singing <unk> singing <unk> One <unk> One <unk> One <unk> One <unk>
Now I would go to the hospital.
The soil has been recorded with a way of <unk> and from the oven, come back to you -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> from the hands of <unk>
All right. So your eyes.
I want to tell you about a simple contest that is in New York City.
It's called the <unk> of the United States in the United States.
I went to cover this event about a few years ago as a journalist -- I think this was like the end of a <unk>
There were several men and a few men and small ladies of different ages and different <unk>
They were <unk> hundreds of numbers, <unk> just a little bit.
And so the names of tens and tens of thousands of dollars.
It would be a little bit <unk>
<unk> to see who could memorize the order of the order of a <unk> of <unk>
And I said, "This is <unk>
These people must be the nature of nature.
And I started talking with some of the <unk>
And this is a man named Ed <unk> who had been from England, and he has one of the best dreams of his mother.
I asked them to <unk> when you realized that you were a <unk>
Paul said, "I am not a <unk>
Actually, I have a lot of <unk>
So all of the things that are going to get out of this competition say that you have normal memory memory of a normal environment.
We have trained us to do these epidemics of memory using some <unk> techniques called <unk> about two years ago in Greece, the same techniques that used <unk> to memorize their <unk> and that dinosaurs were used to memorize books.
And my reaction was, how is it that I had no heard of this <unk>
We were sitting in the middle of the metal, and I asked him who is a wonderful English English and brilliant guy, although a little <unk> told me, <unk> you're an American scholar of an American man.
Do you know what?
And I said, "Oh my God, why don't why? No, why?
So I would like to show you what I would like to tell you about -- how to memorize the order in a room of <unk>
That would change the world that anyone can do it.
And I said, "Well, I'm not <unk> <unk> but maybe you can teach me to me.
I mean, you have to start with something else.
And that was the start of a very strange journey for me.
I ended up at the biggest part of the year not only training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, why sometimes it does not work and what it can be their <unk>
I met a lot of people really interesting.
This is a man called <unk> <unk>
He is <unk> very much with the worst memory in the world.
His memory was so bad that I didn't even master that I had a problem of <unk>
Someone <unk> but it was a window that allows you to see that our memory is what our memory is.
On the other end of the spectrum, I met this guy.
This is a <unk> <unk> He was based on the role of <unk> <unk> in the movie <unk>
We spent one afternoon together in the public library in New York City City, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And at the end, a number of them treated a lot more than 2,000 years ago in Latin, in <unk> in <unk> and then in the Middle East.
And I learned a lot of interesting things about this.
One of the most interesting things that I learned is that there was a time in which this idea of having <unk> <unk> and <unk> was not a good thing as you can think about it.
It was a lot of time -- people would be engaged in their memory, in order to provide their minds.
These techniques have made possible our modern world, but they also made us <unk>
They have changed <unk> and I would say that they have changed the <unk>
And as we have almost no need to remember, sometimes we seem to have forgotten how to do it.
One of the last few places in our planet where there are still people who are suffering from this idea of a <unk> memory and <unk> is this competition as well as possible.
It's actually not so <unk> there are <unk> like this in the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how they do these people.
About a few years ago, a group of researchers from the University of London invited a group of memory from the background of my memory, at the right time.
So they wanted to be able to be able to be able to have any physical form, or <unk> different from the rest of us.
The answer was, no.
They are more smart than the <unk>
They gave them a <unk> <unk> and the answer was actually not.
And there were no such thing and significant difference between the brains of your memory and the subjects of control with the ones that were <unk>
And when they put them in a video game machine, their brains would take their brains as well as <unk> numbers, faces and forms of <unk> they found out that in the hands of memory it would be <unk> parts of the brain.
In effect, they <unk> or seemed to be able to make a part of the brain that involves memory memory and <unk>
Why? There's something that we can learn from this?
The <unk> of <unk> <unk> is changing as a full-time career where every year comes someone with a new way to remember more things, more quickly, and then the rest of them should be able to get to the day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times a piece of paper.
In his desk, in front of him, there are 72 <unk> of <unk> <unk> which he's about to try to memorize in an hour, using a technique that he invented and he just invented and he was just <unk>
He used a similar technique to memorize the exact order of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In a square months.
And while there are a lot of ways to remember things in these innovators -- absolutely all the techniques that we used to at the end of the end of the end of the thing that psychologists call <unk>
This is an unintended consequences, known as the paradox of <unk> <unk> says it -- I say to two people who remember the same thing that I say to you -- that there's a man called <unk>
That is their <unk>
And then I'll tell you that there's a <unk> <unk> <unk>
And when I went home, and I asked them to <unk> that word that I told you about a <unk>
<unk> what <unk> <unk>
The person who told him that his name is <unk> it's a little bit more likely to remember the same word that the person who said her work is <unk>
The same word, the same word, <unk> capacity of <unk> that's enough.
What's going on here? What's going on?
Well, the name is actually nothing for you. It doesn't mean any relationship to you.
And with all the other memories I share with your mother.
But the word <unk> we know <unk> <unk>
They use <unk> <unk>
They have drugs in their hands.
It would be a good way to go back to the <unk>
You probably have a <unk>
And when you get that word for the first time, we started to put <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> at some point in some <unk>
One of the most successful techniques to do this was about two years ago in Greece -- <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of <unk>
The story says this: There was a poet called <unk> which was a <unk>
They were hired as entertainment, because before, if you wanted to give a very good party, you didn't get a <unk> you would get a <unk>
He put out their feet, and she said, <unk> her passion, and she would be <unk> and as soon as the <unk> <unk> was <unk>
I would be <unk>
But not only <unk> they killed everybody, but it turns out the bodies are <unk>
No one could say who was there, nobody could remember where they were going.
And so they couldn't <unk>
A tragedy behind the other, a tragedy behind the other.
And I left my head in the middle of the Shrine <unk> the eyes and realized that with the eyes of his mind, I could see where he had been sitting every day.
I took the family of the hands of the hands of where they were their loved ones between the <unk>
What we do is we go back at that moment is something that we all know more or less <unk> and it is that no matter whether we're not good enough to remember names or numbers, or words of our colleagues, we have a visual memory of our colleagues, we have a visual memory of the <unk>
If I asked them to do the first 10 words of the story that I just tell you about <unk> it's very likely that you can see very hard to do it.
But I would bet that if you were going to say that if you were sitting on the horse -- brown <unk> in your pocket would be able to <unk>
The idea of the memory of memory is to create this building with the eyes of your mind and get out of images with the things that you want to do, the more <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> whether the most <unk> be.
This is a advice that comes from more than 2,000 years ago, to the first share of memory in <unk>
And how does it work?
Let's say that you have been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and want to do it from the same way that I would have done it, if I had invited him to <unk>
What you might do is imagine that you're on the door of your home.
And so you have some sort of image of an absolutely silly <unk> and <unk> to help remember that the first thing you want to say is that competition completely <unk>
And then you can imagine going on to your home, and seeing the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk>
And that would tell you that you want to go to your friend Ed <unk>
And then you would look at <unk> <unk> to remind you that little <unk> that they want to be <unk>
And then you walk in the kitchen, and the fourth thing that I think would be that journey that they did for a year and have some friends for them to help you.
So this is like <unk> <unk> <unk> your <unk> I don't want to know that it's going to remind you -- typical by <unk>
In fact, the term comes from the <unk> <unk> which means <unk> <unk>
This is a <unk> of when people thought in the <unk> and in the details, with this sort of <unk> model.
The phrase <unk> <unk> would be like the first place in his mind, in a way.
I saw that this was just a matter and I got out of it.
I went to some of these <unk> and I had the idea of writing a lot about this <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is a <unk>
Anyway, it's like to see a lot of people sitting sitting on -- I mean, the most exciting thing that happens is when someone gets to <unk>
I'm a journalist and I need to write about something.
I know that there are amazing things going on in the minds of these people, but I don't have to.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story -- I needed to try to put it in your way.
So I started to spend 15 or 20 minutes every morning before I sat down to see the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a <unk> or the names of an old <unk> and the names of a <unk> <unk>
And I discovered that this was <unk>
I would have been waiting for it to do it.
It was <unk> because it wasn't only about training the memory of my life.
So what is really about to do is improve every time the ability to create and imagine these images <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of the mind.
And I would be pretty happy with this.
This is me -- using my heart standard of training for the real memory of my life.
This is a couple of <unk> and a couple of <unk> and a few of them -- leaving only two <unk> because the <unk> is the worst enemy of a <unk>
I ended up coming back to the same contest that I had covered a year before, and I had the idea that I could <unk> in a sort of experiment, <unk>
I thought that this might be a good <unk> for all my research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of it.
And I won the <unk> something that I didn't have to happen.
Of course, it's nice to be able to memorize <unk> and numbers, and you can see this is not the point.
So these are so much <unk> <unk> who work in <unk>
Because it's based on very basic principles about how the brain works.
And it's not necessary that you get to build <unk> of memory or memorize <unk> to benefit from a little bit about how it works in your mind.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it makes a gift of a gift -- but it's not the case.
The big dreams are <unk>
At the most important level, we remember when we pay attention.
<unk> when we focus on a <unk>
The <unk> of the <unk> these techniques are just <unk>
In fact, it's not even <unk>
They work because they work with their work because they do it.
And so a species of processing moving a kind of attention that most of the majority are not going to go there.
But the reality is that there are no <unk>
So it is like the things you do in the <unk>
And if there is something that I want to leave you with today, it's what I do, the <unk> I can't remember that I had a problem, I left me to me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our time.
How many of you are willing to lose what is our <unk> existence in the <unk> or <unk> not paying attention to the human being in front of us, who walk up to us, who will go back to our side.
I learned from the first hand that there are some incredible memory abilities in all of us.
But if you want to live a lifetime -- you must be the kind of person who remembers <unk>
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Today I'm going to talk about the last 30 years of the history of quantum physics.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
This is a complex subject, so we would take a place <unk> New York.
Because 30 years ago, I am about six years old, I was six years old, and lived there in my parents in a village called <unk> and this was my mother.
In the corner, from my <unk> I was the bathroom that would share with my mother.
And between my chest and the bathroom, there was a <unk> which I gave you to the emergency room in the room.
And there were all the time looking at the <unk> so every time I went out of my room to the bathroom, all the time -- and every time I would go back and walked in a bag, I would go back to the <unk>
And I was like this.
It was going to be a <unk>
And I would say, that we would hated that <unk> I hated that room and that home.
This is quantum science.
Thank you.
Those feelings, those feelings, those feelings, those feelings, those emotions that I find that is the power of architecture, because architecture is not about mathematics, but of those connections that we feel in the places that are <unk>
And it's not sure that we feel about that way, because according to the Nobel Prize --  Americans spend 90 percent of their time under the <unk>
I mean, 90 percent of the time we are surrounded by architecture of art.
That's a lot of fun.
The architecture tells us in ways that we don't even give us better.
So that's a little bit <unk> and very, very good.
This means that when I show you a building like this, I know what you do, you think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know that you think about it in a building in a building two years ago.
This is a <unk>
This is a <unk> that they use architects to create a emotional connection with the ways that we build our brains.
This is an emotional connection, we've used this trick for a long time for a long time.
We use it 200 years to build <unk> <unk>
So we use it in the 19th century to build a computer of art.
And in the 20th century, we used to build them to build them.
See, these <unk> <unk> <unk> in front of the sea, go from the <unk>
This is very, very simple, because we build things to be <unk>
It's <unk> it takes a lot of time and it's very interesting.
The people who have <unk> and governments, they are always afraid of innovation, and they prefer to use ways they know that they're going to work.
So we found out with buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
This is the <unk> Library of <unk> which was ended in 2004, in my hometown, and, you know, it has a <unk> -- it has this thing -- it has this thing to look at this thing --       -- it is to communicate with this <unk> the values of property, the story.
But it doesn't have a lot to see with a library in the world.
That same year, in 2004, on the other side of the country, it ended up another piece, which looks like this.
He's in <unk>
So this library shows how we use media media in the digital era of artificial <unk>
This is a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place for a long time, reading and <unk>
So how is it possible that in the same year in the same country, two buildings, two buildings, are so completely different.
And the answer is that architecture works by the beginning of the <unk>
On one side of the side is the <unk> architects that are constantly getting new technologies, new technologies, new solutions, new solutions for human forms of life.
<unk> <unk> and <unk> so we put it completely out of the people.
All of the black, you know, this is what we do, you think we feel very well, but we're dead by because we don't have another problem.
We have to go to the other side and go to the other side with those symbols <unk>
So we do, and we are all happy, but we feel like <unk> so we started experimenting with <unk> we were doing the <unk> of the next minute, and again, we have done it in the last 300 years and of course in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago in the United States.
The architects were very busy doing this with the <unk>
It has to do with <unk>
That's what it looks like.
<unk> <unk> in the <unk>
One really important thing for me is very important.
So we go back to the 1980s, and we started to incorporate those <unk>
And so the whole thing in the other direction.
We take those forms that we know that we like and <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we put them together and we use new experiences.
I'll leave you with you.
We don't take <unk>
We take <unk> <unk> and we combine them in <unk> that they can be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And the ways that we <unk> it on <unk> and <unk>
The <unk> became <unk>
The <unk> grew up until the size of the galaxies were all <unk>
Thank you.
But they were the '80s, that was interesting.
We all spend the time in centers, and we moved to the neighborhoods, and that in the '90s, we could create our own <unk> <unk>
Those suggestions could be to be the <unk> to <unk> or the <unk>
I would be able to do with a <unk> <unk>
This is what happens with the <unk>
This is what happens with the <unk>
These are all <unk> because instead of creating new landscapes of other places.
I know very good, and you all know that this is not the <unk>
This is <unk>
Now, the architects are happy and we started to do the <unk> of the other direction.
In the '80s and early '90s, we started experimenting with the <unk> <unk> called <unk> <unk>
So the symbols of the symbols now have now been with new techniques for new design models, and we find out with new <unk> a few ways that they are <unk>
This is a <unk> and it's <unk> and it's <unk> and it's totally <unk> It's totally <unk>
Normally the <unk> <unk> of a new way.
But then, it was a <unk>
In 1997, it came up this building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building changed the relationship of the world with architecture with quantum physics.
Paul <unk> said that <unk> was one of those rare moments when they threw pictures and public public in general, they were totally filled with a building.
The New York Times, the New York Times, this building of <unk> this <unk>
<unk> in <unk> in <unk> in a year when we ended up building the building.
So suddenly, all of the world wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles Bay Chicago, and New York City <unk>
All the world I wanted to, and I was in all <unk>
He was our first architect to <unk>
But how is it possible that these black forms and <unk> how is it possible to become ubiquitous in the <unk>
And it happened because the media would come across to them and quickly learned that those ways that these forms of culture and <unk>
We've created an emotional reaction with these <unk>
The same thing they did the main shape of the world.
So they all believed that if they had these forms, they had a culture and <unk>
And this phenomenon of the new way of the new <unk>
And I went to <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these few architects of the new architects at the bottom of the new year actually started to go through the entire architecture, social media started to increase the speed of information.
And so, for example, how do you make music to this <unk>
A thousand years ago, you would have walked up until the next village to see a building.
<unk> <unk> can take a boat, an airplane, they can be <unk> they can be <unk>
The technology <unk> you can see in the newspapers, at the end, and at the end, all of us are <unk> and the building is beyond its location in its location itself.
The architecture is in all parts of the world, that means that the speed of communications finally has reached the speed of science.
Because architecture is moving so fast, because the architecture is moving so fast.
It's not accurate enough to think about a building.
It needs a lot of time to build a building, three or four years ago, and at that time, an architect can design two, 2 or 100 buildings, before to know if that was designed four years ago, was a success or not.
Because there has never been a good feedback in architecture, because there's never good feedback in science.
So it's like we have to find out with buildings like this.
The <unk> was not a <unk> of two years ago.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we didn't have any sense of how much <unk>
That is never going to go back to <unk> <unk> because we are at the bottom of the world's largest revolution in architecture from the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk>
My theory is that when it comes to the media media of communication, starts to go back faster until you get to be in both extreme extremes -- and you will find the difference between innovation and more <unk> the architects, the architects, and the Middle East and the Middle East.
Now we can do amazing symbols on the other side.
Let me teach you how the system works in a project that my company ended up with.
We were <unk> to replace this building that was <unk>
This is the middle of a village called <unk> in <unk> Island, in the state of New York City.
It's a community of <unk>
But that meant two years before the building, it was a part of the community, and as the drawings would seem to be exactly the same product, there was no <unk>
The building came to be part of the community, that first summer, when people started to get into the social media, the building left to be just a building, became a process of communication, because these are the images that you did in a building are the images that you did in the building.
And as you can use your history, it becomes part of a personal narrative and it makes it <unk> with real memory and by taking these <unk> and by taking these <unk>
So I mean, we don't need to say we don't need to tell us how to think about it.
We can tell each other, because the digital media is not only changed the relationship between us, but they have changed the relationship between us and the ones that have changed the relationship between us and the animals.
Think about a second at the second one in the <unk>
If that building became a building today, first <unk> to the Internet of <unk> <unk>
And I would take them up with examples of innovation, about what it might be a <unk>
That's <unk>
<unk> who can take the mayor of <unk> to people of <unk> and tell you that there's no real answer to what it can be a library today.
There's a part of this.
So this debate is the freedom of thinking.
All it's different now.
The architects are already not those creatures that use words and drawings and drawings and drawings -- and one is not a public <unk> which is not based on something that hasn't ever seen before.
Now, the architects can listen to them, and you don't get rid of it.
That means that the <unk> of a person to another, of a movement of one of the other.
In fact, we can go forward and find out what to do with the problems that we're talking about.
This is the end of the history of architecture, and it means that buildings in the morning will be very different from the buildings today.
This means that a public space in the former city of <unk> can be only and taught to the extent of a global city.
This means that a stadium in Los Angeles can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad <unk> <unk> <unk> with ideas of what it should be a <unk>
This means that a few robots will be building our buildings, because we finally will be ready for the forms that are going to be <unk>
That means that buildings are <unk> to the <unk> of nature and not the beginning.
So this means that a couple of weeks ago in Miami Beach, Florida, it can also serve to make sure or for <unk> or even you can lose there at night.
This means that three architects can dream with <unk> in the East East New York City, and raising half a million dollars of the community based on that cause, it's not a customer alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little <unk> of <unk> so <unk> and <unk> like the animals that are going to go to <unk>
Because no matter whether it's a cow or a <unk> or a robot who builds our <unk>
It doesn't matter how we grow what it means is what we do is what we do, and what we do is we do it.
The architects already know how to make buildings more <unk> more complex and more <unk>
We've been waiting for all of you to hear the <unk>
And finally, we're not at the top of it.
Five years ago, an architect, <unk> and <unk> together to make better buildings, better cities, better cities, because there are a lot of things in it.
And the buildings not only reflect our society, but they take way up to the most elegant places where we are going to our children, where we are going to our children, and the <unk> of the <unk>
Thank you. Thank you.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It was a year and a year ago, and there was a <unk>
And what's about that very typical way of the children of a year, <unk> as if their body is moving too fast for their <unk>
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that I like to do for the moment is to look at the head.
She doesn't really love his <unk>
And the <unk> and the <unk> and the one day I know the big <unk> and <unk>
It's pretty interesting.
And I remember all your friends do this, and my mom told me that I used to do it, and he made me think about it.
How do we all of a sudden, we're not going to do it with our <unk>
Because, you know, it's not enough.
Every month, 10 people seek out <unk> "I'm <unk> I'm <unk>
This is <unk> it has 13 years and lives in <unk>
And as any <unk> just wants to be a <unk> and <unk>
It's okay for the night.
It's going to go to the next week at school.
It has a little bit of fear, because, despite his mom says her mom says all the time he's beautiful, all the days in school, someone says it is <unk>
One of the things that his mom says and what his friends, or her friends, or her colleagues said, "You don't know who you are.
So it makes a video of it, which makes it in YouTube, and asked them to leave a <unk> "I'm nice or I'm <unk>
Well, until now, <unk> has been over 13 years ago.
Some of these are so <unk> that I don't even care about it.
We are talking about a healthy teenager and stream, which gets these answers in one of the most vulnerable parts of their lives.
Thousands of people are passionate books like this, in its majority of teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what is <unk>
Well, the teenagers today are almost not going to be <unk>
They are under pressure of being in line and available all the time, talking about <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- this is never going to be a <unk>
So before we've been so connected, in a way, in a way, so <unk> so <unk> so <unk>
As a mother told me, "It's like there is a party in his room every day.
It's just <unk>
And the social pressures that go out of your hand is <unk>
This environment, of being always <unk> is <unk> our children to <unk> based on the number of people who have and the types of comments that are <unk>
There's no <unk> between a life in the real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what is true or what it is.
And also, it's very hard to know the difference between which is true, and what is <unk>
What is the most <unk> of somebody in front of someone who is normal in a <unk> context <unk>
And where you're looking at the <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> from the news of the girls in now.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The technique of <unk> is now a <unk>
And trends -- <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those of you who <unk> <unk> <unk> means <unk> <unk>
These trends are associated with women in the popular culture of today.
It's not hard to see what you can compare to the <unk>
But the kids are not <unk>
Like the ones of the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk>
But what is the problem with all this?
Well, we probably want our children to grow healthy and be able to be able to do it.
But in a culture, for the image, we're teaching our children to spend more time and effort to the price of all the other aspects of their <unk>
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical abilities -- their studies and other ways they start to go away.
About six girls prefer not to do something because you think it doesn't look like this.
These are not activities <unk>
These are fundamental activities for its growth as human beings, and as opposed to society and in the developing world.
<s> <unk> percent, almost one of three teenagers are not interested in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> to participate in a classroom -- because they don't want to call the attention of their physical thinking.
One of five are not <unk> to classes at all over the days when they don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the course of that, if you don't think you look good, we specifically think about it, if you don't believe that you are good at, you know, a lower average of the average of your peers who don't care for that of it.
And this phenomenon has changed in Europe, the United States and China, and China, and China, and China, and China, and China, and this phenomenon has changed.
And the day regardless of what we actually use these <unk> these <unk> these <unk>
So why is it going to be as well as you are talking about how you see not about how you do something about how you are.
The low self-esteem of his body is <unk> the <unk> of the <unk>
And it's also <unk> the health.
The adolescents with the <unk> and they do less physical activity -- they eat less fruits and vegetables, they live in more customers, they don't pay for a <unk>
They have a <unk>
They are more effective by the people who go around and they're in greater than they are in <unk>
And we think that's why it's all about what it is so that what you do is that you take more <unk> as the consumption of alcohol and drugs, <unk> surgery -- sexual surgery -- and without protection and harm <unk>
The pursuit of the perfect body is pushing to the healthcare system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we are not <unk>
Women who believe that they have <unk> again, regardless of whether they have higher rates of <unk>
On 17 percent of women are not giving a job interview in a day where they don't feel safe with the way that you get to the way you want.
Think for a moment where this is doing our global economy.
If we could overcome this, what would it be that <unk>
<unk> this potential is for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, I'm talking about -- I don't take you very much.
I don't know.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three different ways -- the first one is that we have to combine trust in their own body.
We have to help our adolescents to develop strategies to develop strategies to overcome the pressure of the perfect images and build their clients.
The good news is that there are many programs available to do it.
The bad news is that most of these are not enough.
I was very impressed when I learned that many programs would be <unk> without realizing it, <unk> <unk>
So we need to make sure that the program that will continue our children not only a positive impact but also a <unk> <unk>
And research studies show that the best programs are focused on six areas, and the first is the influence of family, friends and friends.
These six things are very important points for any of them for anyone who willing to provide education in your body that work.
An education is obvious but to deal with this problem requires that every one of us who take the action on the side and be a better model for women and girls in our own lives.
So the current status of how women are seen and raised in our minds.
It's not good to say with the contribution of our politicians in order of hair, or the size of their <unk> or the size of their <unk> or of <unk> that the <unk> success is the fact that it's not a great thing.
We need to start to pay people for people so they are, not just as you can imagine.
We all can start to be doing the responsibility for the kind of images and comments that we published in our social media.
We can get the people based on the people based on their effort and their actions and not in their minds.
And let me tell you, when it was the last time that <unk> a <unk>
In short, we have to work together as communities, as governments, and as companies, to change our culture, so that our children will be able to get the entire person, and we can do the <unk>
We have to put people who are actually <unk> the difference in a <unk> <unk>
To make a difference in the real world, we do it as they go on the big screen because we just create a different world in a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they believe that they can see that they are not the <unk> of being who they are, or to reach what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in their lives.
If you have in <unk>
And his <unk>
And his <unk>
And his <unk>
And his <unk> her <unk>
It might be the woman who is going to two <unk> <unk> What would it mean for him if it was <unk> from that voice <unk> in her face, that he would have died by not having fallen legs more <unk> feet more often.
What would it mean for him if we were doing this and we would be able to pay their potential of that this?
Now, the obsession of our culture with the images is that we all agree to everyone.
But <unk> our children the truth.
And so what the way you see is just a part of your identity and that the truth is that the truth is that we love them for those are and why they do it.
And I would say to the self-esteem of our schools.
So we are every one of us, the way we talk and we look at other people.
And we would put together as a community, from a small community, from small groups to governments, so that the little <unk> of a year in the age of the age of the age of <unk>
Thank you. Thank you.
On the left five of 2011, a man named <unk> <unk> walked into a hotel in Manhattan and killed the <unk> <unk> <unk> the leader of <unk> <unk>
In <unk> we would be able to do it, but in the middle of the other parts of the rest of the rest of the rest of each other, they started planning a few <unk> <unk> in New York City.
In some sort of plans to be <unk> by an informant called <unk>
Sadly, the <unk> <unk> in the World Trade Center couldn't be able to do it.
More afternoon, <unk> would be <unk> by their participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my dad.
I was born in Latin, in harmony with him being an engineer, with an engineer, with an American worker with an American mother school teacher professor at the age of the two <unk>
Just when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a way of Islam, which I really understood even most of the <unk> are going to be <unk>
And so I saw that when people take time for them, they don't have a lot to do the same things in life, because the same stuff in life.
However, in all religion, in all of us, there are always a little fraction of people who are going to be able to deal with their <unk> who think that there are all the things that we all lived like them, so everybody lived like them.
A few months before Mr. grandfather, he sat me with me and explained to me that in the last few years, he and some friends had been going to training on Long Island to go back to <unk>
He told me that I would go with him at the next day again.
We went to the <unk> of <unk> which didn't know our group, was in the <unk>
And when I got <unk> my father helped me hold the <unk> on the floor, and he explained to me how to deal with the goal for about 30 minutes.
That day, with the last <unk> I took the little light on the goal and to surprise myself, especially I, especially I, especially me, all of the goal was in <unk>
My uncle became the other and in Arabic, he said, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my father, as she said, <unk>
They all, the comment they produced a lot of fun, but only a few years later, I understood what they wanted to do as well.
You saw in me, the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
Those people later would be able to put them down to put it up on a <unk> and put them up with 700 pounds of <unk> in the <unk> area of the World Trade Center -- causing an explosion that killed six people and <unk>
I told those questions.
The <unk> called <unk> which means <unk> <unk>
And when I was 14, I had already moved 20 times the progress during my childhood not allowed to make a lot of <unk>
And every time I started to feel comfortable about someone who was just a little bit of <unk> and you get another city.
As I was always my own face in the middle of the middle of the middle of <unk>
<unk> <unk> my identity to avoid being the <unk> but it will be the new class of the class -- it was enough <unk>
So most of the time I spent time reading books, watching TV or video games or video games.
And for these reasons I haven't developed social skills to put them up under <unk> it wasn't prepared for the real world.
And I would put it back to the people, with people with <unk> <unk> like their race or their <unk>
So how could we open the <unk>
One of the first experiences that they put in trial my way of thinking, was during the age of <unk>
In a <unk> program where I went back in the <unk> <unk> in <unk>
My group was <unk> in the subject of violence, like I had been a victim of <unk> almost all my life, was something that I felt like a lot of it.
The members of this group came from this group of different <unk>
One day, to the end of the <unk> I discovered that one of the kids who we had done before, was <unk>
I took a few days back to the light and I realized that there was no <unk> between the two of the two <unk>
I never had a friend of mine, and I really felt very proud to have been able to deal with the barrier that all life had made me believe that it was <unk>
Another critical moment emerged when I got a work in London in Bush -- a <unk> park in <unk>
I found myself with people of all sorts of beliefs and leadership, that experience it turned out fundamental in the developing world.
The whole life had taught me that the <unk> was a sin and, because the gay rights were bad <unk>
And I had the opportunity to work with gay actors there, in a <unk> and I could see that several of them were the most popular and least important ones that had seen in life.
Having been a child, I developed a sense of empathy to the suffering of the suffering of the suffering but it wasn't easy for me to try to try to figure out exactly how I would have to be <unk>
And so I could go to the <unk> who had taught me a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know how it's going to be true, but I know what it is to be able to get out of my head.
And then the <unk> <unk> <unk>
All night, I would say I would be able to be <unk> honest with my <unk> and I'm going to see that the race of people, religion or religion or sexual orientation, don't have anything to do with the <unk>
In many ways he became my <unk> at a time where I was desperately <unk>
In the end, the inspiration can come from the <unk> and that a lawyer would have had a better influence in my life than my own father, <unk>
One day I had a conversation with my mother about how I was changing my way of thinking, and she told me something that I would lose in my heart for all of you.
She looked at me with the eyes of someone who has suffered enough to <unk> <unk> and he said, "I'm <unk> <unk> <unk>
At that time I realized how much energy you need to keep all of that hate in your brain.
My real name is not <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why did I go out and put it in a possible way, and put it in a possible way?
Well, it's it.
I've done because I hope that someone, some day, who is going to take the violence, can hear my story and understand that there are a better way that even though I'm going to give you this violent ideology and <unk> I would be <unk>
In the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight corruption, and to the <unk>
I do it by the victims of terrorism and by their loved ones, because of the terrible pain and the loss that terrorism has produced in their lives.
For the victims of terrorism to speak, against those traits that no matter how Egypt is to take care of my dad.
With this reason, I asked him here as a proof that violence is not inherent to no religion or <unk> that children don't have to keep the ones in their parents' lives.
I'm not my dad.
Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.
In this moment, there is a film that shows in their minds.
It's a movie <unk>
It's in 3D 3D, and it has sound <unk> of what you hear and you see right now, but that's just the beginning.
Your movie, you have a <unk> you have <unk> and <unk>
It feels your body, your pain, your pain, your <unk>
It has dignity and happiness.
It has money, like times of your childhood age, which is going to be on your eyes.
And it has a <unk> voice, in your flow of thinking.
The heart of the movie, you are yourself who experience everything in your body.
This film is your flow of awareness, the subject of the experience and the world.
<unk> is one of the fundamental truths of human existence being human being human life.
Every one of us is <unk>
We all have a new movie, you, you and you do it.
There is nothing that you can do more often.
So at least I know that I have an emotional awareness of it.
I don't have any sure that you will be able to be able to be creative.
The consciousness is also the reason for being a living.
If we were no longer aware of anything in our lives would have sense or value.
But at the same time it's the most mysterious phenomenon of the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these films <unk>
Why are we not only robots that we have to produce to produce outcomes without experience the movie <unk>
In this moment, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
<unk> that to integrate consciousness in science, you need some basic ideas for science to happen.
Some people say it is impossible for a science of creativity.
The science, because of nature, it is <unk>
The awareness, of nature, is <unk>
So you can never have a science of consciousness.
Because during almost all the 20th century, it would be <unk> that <unk>
Now, the psychology of psychology was called <unk> behavior, and neuroscience was studying the brain, but nobody was never just talking about it.
Even 30 years ago, when TED -- when TED was very few of these very few social media programs about creativity.
<unk> 20 years ago, everything started to change.
<unk> like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the moment for the science of <unk> <unk>
And since then, there was a real <unk> one of the most scientific work on <unk>
And this work was very interesting.
But it also has fundamental limitations until the moment.
The center of the consciousness of consciousness in recent years was the pursuit of <unk> Clark among some areas of the brain, and some states of consciousness.
So we saw something in this kind of great work that introduced Nancy <unk> a few minutes ago.
Now we understand much better, for example, the areas of the brain that are related to traditional experience or feeling pain or feeling pain or feeling like something.
But this is still the science of <unk>
It's not a science of <unk>
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain types of experiences, but we don't know why.
I would like to tell you that this kind of work of neuroscience responds some questions that we want to explain to you. The questions about what makes certain areas of the brain and what it is.
But in a sense, those are the problems that are <unk>
No one of the <unk>
In fact, there are no basic problems with creativity.
Well, it's not the real mystery of this <unk> why all the physical design in the brain have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be honest.
Why is it a <unk> movie, why is a <unk>
In this moment, we can't do it.
And you can say it was a few years ago.
It's going to convert another emerging phenomenon like <unk> like <unk> as life as life, and we're going to find <unk>
The <unk> <unk> are all of the cases of human behaviors, how do they work -- how they work -- how do they get <unk> and <unk> the organisms -- all of these are questions about how we move forward.
That can apply the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain, like a <unk> phenomenon, how we talk about how we talk about how we play <unk> all are questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about behavior are between the <unk> problems in the world.
But the hard problem is the question why is it that everything is going on from a <unk> experience.
And here is the standard paradigm of the <unk> the standard paradigm of <unk> actually doesn't have a lot to say it doesn't have a lot to say.
I am a <unk> <unk>
I mean, a scientific theory of the <unk> who worked for a long time, I put my head on the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in physical terms that would work.
But at the end I came to the conclusion that that it didn't work for reasons it was <unk>
I think we would do it at this point.
We have a supply of wonderful explanations -- well, the physics explains the chemistry explains the chemistry explains biology, biology, biology explains part of the <unk>
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit in this <unk>
On one side, it is a fact that we are able to do this.
So for another, we don't know how to put that idea to our scientific vision of the world.
I think history right now, it's sort of a <unk> thing that we need to integrate our vision of the world, but we don't know that we don't know it.
With a <unk> like this, you can need ideas -- I think we need ideas that at the beginning of the beginning of being able to deal with the awareness of a scientific design.
There are some possibilities for those <unk> <unk> <unk>
My friend Dan <unk> who is here today, has one one, has one one.
His idea crazy is that there is no such thing as a hard problem.
So the idea of the notion of the audience is an illusion of illusion or <unk>
Actually, what you need to do, is to explain the functions of the brain, and so you know everything that you need to say about what you need for.
Well, more power to it.
That is the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of consciousness -- <unk> in the brain.
At the same time for me and for many of them, that vision is pretty close to simply fixing the observation that the awareness of consciousness is <unk>
But I am in a different direction but I'm in a different direction but I'm in a different form.
In the time I want to explore two amazing ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first big idea is that consciousness is very important.
The physicists sometimes take some of the aspects of the universe like a <unk> space, the time and the <unk>
<unk> laws that <unk> like the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics or <unk>
And these laws and properties of fundamental properties not explain in terms of nothing more important.
Now, the other thing is, you know, <unk> and there is the world.
Sometimes, the list of the fundamental things is <unk>
In the 19th century, it was found that you can't explain the natural phenomena in terms of very fundamental concepts of different kinds of moral concepts -- <unk> <unk> and <unk> the basic laws of <unk> and <unk> the <unk> laws like a fundamental concept that those <unk>
I think that is the situation where we find out what we find out with you.
If you can't explain your awareness in terms of fundamental ideas, space, it would be <unk> then by the way, you have to be a <unk>
The more natural it would be <unk> the awareness as something fundamental -- a fundamental <unk> of nature.
This doesn't mean that anyway, not whether it's an object of science, science is not the science of science, it doesn't matter to science of science, this doesn't matter.
But it opens up the way to <unk>
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness -- the laws that connect the awareness with other concepts -- space, space, the time, the <unk>
The physicists sometimes say that we want to be very simple laws that we can do in a <unk> <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
So we want to find the fundamental laws that we can do in a <unk> way.
We still don't know what the laws are, but that's what it is. But that's what it is.
The second idea is that consciousness can be <unk>
Every system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision sometimes is called <unk> <unk> for all, in mind, every system is conscious -- not only human beings -- the dogs can compare the microbes in the microbes in the microbes and the dark particles and the <unk>
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or smart or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be full of <unk> when you think about the speed of light.
I can never move and smell the <unk>
No, so no.
But the thought is that perhaps photons can have any item of negative feeling -- some <unk> <unk> of <unk>
This may sound a little bit crazy for you.
How would someone think about something so <unk>
In part this comes from the first idea that consciousness is a very important thing.
If it's obvious as space and space, the time it is natural to assume that it can also be universal as the other ones each other.
It's also worth to notice that even though the idea seems to be <unk> it's much less for the people of different cultures, where the human mind seems more a continuum with nature.
A more profound reason comes from the idea that perhaps the simplest way and powerful to find the fundamental laws that we <unk> the thinking with the physical process is that consciousness with information.
You always need to be able to information, there are <unk>
<unk> <unk> -- as in a human being, awareness of <unk>
So you can do it with simple information.
One very exciting thing is that in the past couple of years, a neuroscientist, <unk> <unk> I took this kind of theory and developed <unk> with <unk>
It has a math of processing data, which is called <unk> which is the degree of information in a system.
And it's supposed to be that <unk> has to look at the <unk>
So in a human brain, there is an incredible degree of data, a high degree of <unk> a lot of <unk>
In a mouse in a mouse in terms of information, as much as <unk> of consciousness quite important.
But when it comes to the <unk> <unk> the degree of <unk>
The level of information is wrong, but it's not zero yet.
In the theory of <unk> there will still be a different level of consciousness in a different way.
In fact, a fundamental law of <unk> high degree of <unk> high degree of consciousness.
And also, another reason is that the <unk> can help us integrate the awareness of physical thinking.
The physicists and emotions have often looked look at the physics of the physical world.
And so the structure of the reality is using a lot of <unk> but we don't talk about the reality of the reality that we're doing.
As he explains Stephen Hawking, who is where he comes out of the <unk>
From the view, the equations of physics can leave as they are, but you can use the flow of humanity, but you can use the flow of consciousness.
That is what physicists do basically described the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, consciousness is what you put out in the <unk>
In that vision, consciousness is not about the physical world as a species of <unk>
It's there in the <unk>
So this vision, I think, <unk> vision has the potential for <unk> our relationship with nature, and it can have social and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical problems.
Some people can be <unk>
And I used to think that I didn't eat anything that I had awareness, so I should be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you take that vision, you have a lot of <unk>
I think we should be thinking, well, this tends to transform your memories, whereas what matters in terms of <unk> and <unk> is not so much the fact that the fact of awareness, but their <unk>
It also is natural to ask for consciousness in other systems, like computers and computers and friends.
What is about the system of an artificial intelligence system in the movie <unk>
It's <unk>
According to the vision of the <unk> <unk> she has an processing processing processing so that the answer is yes, if it's possible.
If this is right now, it would be a very complex problems about the ethics of the development of smart computers and the ethics of <unk>
Finally, you can ask for human consciousness -- the planet.
Canada has their own <unk>
Or a more local, a more local, a <unk> group like the audience at a TED Talk, at this moment we have a collective awareness of this new group of this whole new group of films in every single <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least it's a question that should be a question that should take a little bit of <unk>
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical, and I don't know if it's right right now.
Now, I'm more sure the first idea -- that consciousness is a fundamental thing that the second thing I can do is to make it.
The vision is a lot of questions, as a lot of challenges, like, how these bits of thinking provide the kind of collective consciousness that we know about and on.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we're going to go through the right way to a theory of consciousness today.
If no, it probably is the most difficult problem of science and compassion -- and the <unk>
We can't wait for the night to the morning.
But I think we finally will go to <unk>
Our consciousness is the real <unk> I think, to understand the universe and to help us understand it.
Maybe we just need the idea crazy right now.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
I grew up in a small village in Italy.
And I had a very normal <unk> a very normal experience.
I went to school, I went to school, with my friends, my sisters to my sisters and the <unk>
It was very normal it was very low.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community came to my parents because I wanted to <unk> for a prize of the community.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very amazing, but there's a very nice problem with it.
She actually had no <unk>   And they had to tell you.
I went to school, I was good at, after school, I had a <unk> in the <unk> of my mother, and I spent a lot of time looking at the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yes, what do you say?
But they had to do it.
I didn't do anything that it was the most remarkable thing in all.
Nothing that can be like an achievement if you take the disability out of the universe.
Some years later, being in the second part of teaching in a high school school in <unk> so only after about 20 minutes in the middle class class, a kid raised the hand and said, "Hey, when you get your <unk>
And I said, "What do you <unk>
Well, I had been talking about the law of <unk> for about 20 minutes, 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your <unk> <unk> <unk>
So when people in <unk> are talking about things about <unk>
They don't usually know in the middle of <unk>
And it was so when I realized that this child had lived with people with disability as objects of <unk>
And not what we do, and it's not about the <unk> it's true for many of us.
For us, people with disability are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We are not <unk> <unk> we're there for <unk>
And in fact, I'm in this stage of what I do in this chair -- and you probably are hoping that you're waiting for you.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid of <unk> <unk>
I'm not here for <unk>
I'm here to tell you that they have been working in relationship to the <unk>
Yes, they have sold us the lie that the disability is something that makes it <unk>
It's a bad thing to live with a disability or a <unk>
It's not a bad thing and not to do it."
And in the last few years, we've been able to get more of this lie through social communication, social communication, social communication, social communication, social communication, social communication, social communication, social communication, social communication, social communication, social communication, social communication, social communication, social communication, social communication, social communication, social communication, social communication, social communication, social communication, social communication, social communication, social communication, social communication, social communication, social communication, social communication,
It's possible that you have seen images like this: The only disability in life is a bad thing.
Or this <unk> <unk> is <unk>
Or this <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there's a huge amount of them.
It might be that you've seen one of the girl with no hands on a piece of paper.
It might have seen a child who runs with his legs <unk>
And there are a lot of these images, which are what we call inspiration <unk>
And we use the term <unk> <unk> because we have a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, we would be <unk> at the <unk> of the people without <unk>
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so that we can see them and say, "Well, for very bad that my life might be better.
I might be that <unk>
But if you are that <unk>
And I've lost the number of times that I've been interested in strangers -- express that I believe that I am <unk> or a source of inspiration, and this was just before my work had a <unk> public.
It was as if I was going to go back to the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
So these images, those images are <unk> people with disability in benefit from people without <unk>
They are there so that you can look at them and think that things are not so bad for you, or to put their issues in perspective.
And life as a human person is actually a difficult hard hard.
I would do some things.
But the things that we undertake are not the things that you can do, but the things that you can think about.
They're not the things that our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> because I'm going to take you to the social model called <unk> which tells us that we are more conservative, because of the society that we live because of our bodies or another.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very excited with it.
So the things that I need to do, and I've learned to take the best of its capacity as you do, and that's what happens with the children of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything out of their common <unk>
They simply are using their bodies to make the best part of their time.
So it's really just <unk> in the way that we do, to share those <unk>
When people say, "You're going to be a <unk> <unk> which says like a <unk>
And I know why it works.
It's because of the <unk> because they have sold this lie that disability makes us <unk>
And I am not doing it.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here to show you the inspiration, and you say, "Why are you going to go to God, you don't even remember <unk>
And actually, I know I'm going to do that.
<unk> of other people with disability all over time.
However, not <unk> I'm more honest than them.
And so this is a very cool idea to use a lot of <unk> <unk> to collect the things that are going on --  -- <unk> the classic trick of how to drive your mobile phone phone in the <unk>
Thank you. Thank you.
And the force and resistance of the other others are not against our bodies and our bodies -- but against a world that <unk> and we <unk>
I really believe that that lie that have been sold about disability is the biggest <unk>
It makes us hard enough life for us.
And that quote: <unk> is the only disability in life is a bad <unk> the reason that that is true is because it's not about because of the social model.
A lot of mystery, a lot of brochures to a <unk> has never done in a <unk>
<unk>                                      I don't have to be a <unk>
And not a lot of people in the middle of a <unk> and <unk> an individual attitude to convert all of those books into it.
It's just not going to happen.
I want to live in a world where disability is not the exception, but the <unk>
I want to live in where a little girl sitting in his chest, looking at the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> not <unk> of anything like being in a <unk>
I want to live in a world where we don't have so low expectations of the people with disability that we will be able to be able to go out of bed and remember our names of the morning.
And I want to live in a world where we need to focus on the <unk> of people with goals, and I want to live in a world where a child at 11 o'clock school school is not a little bit surprised from the <unk>
The disability doesn't make us <unk> but to question what you think about it, I know what it looks like.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
What do you have to see the reality of the reality of the <unk>
And what is the average speed of a <unk>
Unfortunately, today I'm just going to answer one of those questions, so why don't you do that?
So when people think about <unk> you think in <unk> <unk> and in Tom <unk> <unk> the hands in the air, but the reality is not science <unk>
The reality is that is something that will happen in our days and happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to know, because the reality is we can actually measure our lives as well as the Internet and them.
So how we get to the reality <unk>
The first step, the first step, is what I'm going to show you.
I'm sure many of you are familiar with it.
What you might not know is that Google <unk> are a device that allows you to see what I do.
They will allow them to experience what it is to be a professional <unk> in the desert.
Now, the only way to be in the field is that I would try to make it <unk>
I have to use questions.
I have to create a framework that you have to do with your experience with your life.
We can use Google <unk> under a dog, and to know what it is to run by the field of play to double <unk> the blood vessels.
We can know that it feels like a man of a <unk> and we will be trying to make it <unk> with everything else.
And I've been there and I promise you that it's not true.
And so some videos to show you what it is to use the Google <unk> and give them a sense of it.
Unfortunately, it's not images of the practices of the <unk> because the idea of the technology of technology is an area of the surface of the surface.
So let's look at a <unk>
Chris Anderson: Thank you.
It's great to be <unk>
A few years ago, a few years ago.
<unk> <unk>
Thank you.
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> which is a <unk> of what it is to be <unk> in the MRI field of <unk>
You have to realize that lack of people, the rest of the team, the rest of it.
We have a video of them, <unk> from the University of <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Three <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Chris <unk> This is the thing about the feeling being in the field, but it doesn't have anything to do with being in the <unk>
<unk> want to be that <unk>
The <unk> want to be in the field to be in the field -- and they've wondered about YouTube and in <unk> she can see from the angle of a <unk>
or a <unk>
We want to do that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google and Google and Google and Google and Google -- how we put it on the next <unk>
We took it to that level using something called <unk> <unk> which is probably a lot of all kinds of things.
The <unk> <unk> has been described as the most effective device ever created, and it's not <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I'm going to show you how it looks like this.
Louis <unk>
No, no, I don't want to go to the <unk>
Oh, thank you.
And that's the experience of a man in a <unk> <unk> for her life.
What would be the experience of a fan when I put a video out of a ball, and you put the line, <unk> from a <unk> with the arm before you run and make a <unk> What will be the experience of a <unk>
And when it can be <unk> he picks up the <unk> and put it down on the bottom of the <unk> or <unk> making a <unk>
What's your experience when the experience of a mountain is more than 100 <unk> as a <unk> <unk>
Maybe the sales <unk> for those of you to be <unk>
But this is not actually <unk>
It's just different, <unk>
How do we get <unk>
And so the reality is, when <unk> <unk> and owners look at the information that people want to see and say, "How do you use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use technology to win.
They would like to pay them any money.
So here's a little bit about technology in the <unk>
In <unk> the <unk> of Baltimore put a <unk> to their <unk> of the field of <unk> so that the more <unk>
It was a little bit <unk>
Other teams make <unk> <unk>
More people saw the game -- because it was more difficult to slow it out.
In 1994, the <unk> put it in the <unk> of <unk> and then in the <unk> of <unk>
They were more <unk> because it was easier to be more <unk>
In <unk> imagine that it's a player coming to their group and you see the next step in front of you in front of you, in a little bit of plastic that take you in, you don't have to worry about it.
or to memorize the <unk>
You just go to the field and <unk>
And the shoes they want because if they don't keep their instructions, they lose themselves and they hate to lose <unk>
If you lose them -- if you lose them as <unk>
And they don't want it.
But the reality is, it's not just a <unk> of strategies <unk>
The reality is that it's also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your way of playing the <unk>
How does it work?
Well, a very simple option would be a camera in every corner of the stadium, having a view from the top of the people who are born.
You also get information from the sensors in the middle, and the <unk> something that is already going on right now.
And all of that information is going to be <unk>
The good teams will know <unk> <unk>
The bad things are going to be <unk>
This is <unk> the good teams of the <unk>
So your team of mine will be as important as your <unk> and the analysis of data to be just for <unk>
It's also for <unk> who would have <unk>
How would it be in the <unk>
So imagine that they're <unk> <unk>
And I would say, <unk>
And you can see a receptor receptor receptor -- a <unk> on the left of your bombsight -- which is a defense behind you is going to be <unk> but the system is going to be <unk> but <unk>
<unk> in the area of <unk>
Another <unk> you know, you know, there's a receptor on it.
<unk> <unk> but you get <unk>
And it doesn't sound the <unk>
You don't know where the receptor is. But the receptor looks at its exact exact area of the grass that goes down, and it can make it <unk>
It's <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk>
The <unk> <unk> and <unk> have followed the start of each other.
This is something that we create a massive object in the universe.
So I'm going to take a lot of people on it, because people want to live that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field of <unk>
They want to be their <unk>
The reality is to be part of the class, because it is too profitable for not to do it.
But what I ask you is that this is the only use of the reality that actually <unk>
We're going to use it just as bread and <unk> as our entertainment <unk>
Because I think we can use it for something more.
I think we can use the reality to encourage the empathy between human beings to show someone how to be in the middle of another person.
We know what this technology is worth for the <unk>
It takes thousands of millions of income to the year per year.
But how long is this technology for a professor in the classroom trying to show you a <unk> how about your actions from the perspective of <unk>
How long does this technology worth this technology for a gay in Uganda or Russia, trying to show the world how they live in <unk>
How is it worth of a <unk> <unk> or a Neil <unk> or a <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think more in space and science and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, the really interesting thing is that it is <unk>
The questions we do, the decisions we take and the challenges we face, and the challenges we face, like all, from us.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
I recently asked me after 23 years of service in the <unk> <unk> of <unk>
Most of those 23 years ago, I spent the last 23 years in the Bay Area which includes the <unk> <unk>
So the bridge is a <unk> structure known by its beautiful view of San Francisco, the United States and the <unk> <unk>
Unfortunately, it's also a needle for <unk> being one of the most used places in the world.
The <unk> <unk> was open in <unk>
Joseph <unk> an expert by building the head of building the bridge, said that, the bridge is pretty much about <unk>
The Chinese from the bridge is not a <unk> nor <unk>
But from their <unk> <unk> people have signed up their death from that day.
Some people believe that travel in the middle of the two regions of this bridge has been <unk> like that, which is that each of them took you from all your plans and pain, and the waters that go under <unk> your <unk>
But let me tell you that it happens when the bridge is used to make sure you have to do it.
After a free of four to five seconds, the body gets out of water, about 120 miles per hour.
The strong impact of the <unk> some of which we <unk> organs for granted.
Most of the <unk> in <unk>
The ones that not, usually the <unk> in the water, and then they <unk>
I don't think that the ones that are <unk> this method of water, you can see the <unk> death of the <unk>
This is the <unk>
Except, about the two days, there are 32 meters of steel on the ground.
So here is where most people get out of their life.
I can tell you for experience that once the person is at the top, and at its most dark time it is very hard to go back to it.
I took this photo last year as this young man, and this young lady talked to her life.
I want to tell you with joy that we had success that day in the <unk> of <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we didn't have any training <unk>
<unk> to use the way through these <unk>
This was not only a bad service service for those who would be <unk> but the Jews as well.
We've spent a long way since we were doing a long way since then.
Today, Saudi Arabia and psychologists put the new <unk>
This is a <unk>
I met the <unk> <unk> of the last year to get a call from a possible machine, which I was sitting on in the <unk>
<unk> and when I go back to London to visit an official official official with a <unk> <unk>
And I was only 32 years old, and there were only 32 years ago.
In fact, there were only two times before New Year's times from New York to try to kill them from this <unk>
After about an hour of an hour talking with <unk> asked us if we knew the story of the <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> He created a <unk> and he sent the Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> I would never forget that <unk>
Well, one day, how could it be more than <unk> and she opened up the box, and she opened up the box.
So she came up with <unk> and all kinds of <unk> and all kinds of <unk>
The only thing in the box was <unk>
And so I asked him, "What if you open the box and you don't have <unk>
He stopped a <unk> he leaned down on the right, and he came up with the right, and he was dead.
This kid with the <unk> and <unk> of New York -- I just put my life.
I spoke with the parents of London that night, and I guess that when I was talking with them, I didn't seem to be very happy -- because the next day I was going to see how it was.
The parents of mine had to do it.
The damage to the heart rate comes to a lot of people.
Let me explain these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or someone loved <unk>
What <unk>
<unk> what would you say?
In my experience, there are not only one thing to speak, but there are no one that you know, but you have to hear it.
<unk> for a long time.
And not <unk> <unk> or tell the person who you know about how you do, because you probably don't know what it is.
And just in there, you can be there, you can be the point of <unk>
If you think that someone is <unk> you don't have afraid of <unk> and do the question.
One way to give you the question is: <unk> in similar circumstances have thought about it, and you have these <unk> you've had these <unk>
And I would say to the person in front of you can get life and be the point of <unk>
Other kinds of signs to <unk> equality, believe that things are terrible and they're never going to be <unk> <unk> believe that there is nothing that you can do to the <unk> <unk> social <unk> and the interest in life.
And I came up with this talk a couple of days, and I got an email from a lady and I would like to read her hand.
She lost his son after January of this year, and he wrote this email about just a couple of days, and it was with her permission and blessing that was <unk>
Now, <unk> I imagine that you are at the TED conference TED.
It should be a whole experience there.
I'm thinking that I should go back to the bridge that I would end up in the end of my week.
I just wanted to give you an example.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it with your friends who tell their friends, and so I hope to go to your friends, and so on.
I still am pretty <unk> but I would find more times of what Mike didn't go back to the home.
Mike was driving from <unk> to San Francisco to see the football game party with her father at 2 p.m.
I never got there.
And I called the police <unk> and it would take them to <unk> that night, that night.
On the next morning, two troops came to my home and asked me what the car car was down in the <unk>
A witness I'd seen from the bridge to the bridge to the <unk> of the day before.
Many because because of fighting those who can be sold too weak to fight them for them all.
Who hasn't been before not been before not having a real disease.
It shouldn't be so easy to end with it.
My friends are going to go to your <unk>
The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is supposed to be a curator through our beautiful <unk> not a <unk>
Chris Anderson: Thank you.
I can't imagine the value that she would take to go to the bridge and go to the bridge that her son took that day, and also the value to go back to it.
I would like to introduce you to a man that I mean with hope and <unk>
On March of March of March of March of 2005, I remembered a radio call for a possible possible possible way, in the back of the bridge on the floor.
And I would go back to the White House and watched this man, Kevin <unk> in the <unk>
And when I put me up, I would immediately put the <unk> and it stopped in that little tube that goes around the <unk>
During the time and a half years old, I heard as Kevin Kelly talked about his depression and <unk>
Kevin decided to do that day to go back to the <unk> and give life another more opportunity.
When Kevin <unk>
"This is a new beginning, a new one.
But I asked him what he did was what he did -- and he gave him the hope and his life another day.
And you know what it is.
He said, "I'm <unk>
I would be talking about and simply <unk> <unk>
So after that happened, I got a letter from my grandfather, and I have that letter -- and I would like to show you <unk>
It was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> events of <unk> and you're one of the reasons why Kevin <unk> is going on with us.
I mean, I think Kevin was going to be <unk>
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness for which has been properly <unk>
And I asked Kevin to Kevin when I was six months old, completely unconscious of all those traits -- but because of God, now we can do it.
So Kevin is in order, like the <unk>
We give God to God for you.
<unk> in debt with <unk>
And at the end she said, <unk> When I visited the king of San Francisco that night, you would be <unk> like the patient's <unk>
And I would say I had to do it.
Today Kevin <unk> is a <unk> father and an active father of society.
It talks about the events of that day and their depression with hope that their story will inspire each other.
Eighty is not just something that I've found in the work.
It's hard.
My grandfather was <unk> with <unk>
That act, despite the end of his own pain, I understood the opportunity to go to the <unk>
This is what makes it <unk>
For most people -- for most people -- or those who don't think about it, don't think of another person.
They just want their own pain <unk>
And so often, this is just about three <unk> drugs or drugs or drugs or death.
In my career, I've been involved and I've been involved and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illnesses and calls from <unk> around the world.
So in those cases that I've been directly involved only -- I've only lost two, but those two are there.
One was <unk>
The other was a man who told me about a <unk>
During that time, I would put my hand in three months.
In the end, I looked at me, and he said, <unk> I'm sorry, but I have to give you a <unk>
And <unk>
It was absolutely <unk>
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of people that we get to the bridge on that bridge are not <unk>
In addition to those few people who have found out of the bridge and lived and lived and they can talk about it, that one or <unk> most of those people have said that the second one of those people have made a mistake and they wanted to do it.
I say to people, the bridge not only connects to San Francisco, but also the people, but also the people.
That connection, or a bridge that we do, is something that everybody and every one of us should be <unk>
<unk> can be <unk>
There's <unk>
Thank you. Thank you.
The world does that you're not what you don't do, but in your inside you know what you are, and a question you can do in that?
I have to be one of the only things in that sense, but I'm not sure any way I am at all.
And when I became a <unk> I felt the dream that I had ever been since I did the dream I had ever been before.
My left finally come up with my truth -- with my myself sitting there.
And so I would say that I'm going to go back when I look at this picture, I think, <unk> <unk> <unk>
But the last one, I discovered that, <unk> I'm going to show you what I'm asking.
All of us <unk> our families, our families, our religion, our society, our time in history, even our bodies.
Some have the value of <unk> to get rid of the limitations of the skin of the skin or the beliefs of the beliefs of those of us.
These are people who are always interested in <unk> which is what it looks like.
In my case, the last nine years -- many of my friends, many of my friends, my agent even ignored my story.
I think this guy is called <unk> <unk>
This is my mother.
And I would take him as <unk> because I was born in the middle of my head.
I remember my five years ago in my house, I was always wearing this <unk> in his head.
And my mom asked me, "Why don't you just take that <unk>
I said, <unk> is my <unk> I'm a <unk>
And I knew so much <unk>
The gender has always been a fact -- but now we know that, in fact, we know that, actually, it's more complex and <unk>
Because of my success, I would never be able to share my story, not because I think to be what I'm wrong, but why the world is to those of us who want to <unk>
All the days I would be able to be <unk>
I have mom, my dad and a family that would give me like this.
Many of them are so <unk>
There's a long tradition in the <unk> culture, which is the mystery of success.
There are a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk>
There's a <unk> <unk> <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party at the top of the <unk>
I was in front of the stage and I remember that this beautiful woman came to me, and I remember that moment as I would do, this is the kind of woman I would like to be.
And when I was 15 years old, when I was still born from man, I met this woman called <unk> <unk>
This is the head of a contest of <unk> <unk> <unk>
That night she asked me, "Why haven't you ever been in the contest of <unk>
He said to me that if I would take it out of the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and that night, he won in <unk> and that night, he won in <unk> <unk> and I was third <unk>
That time my life changed my life.
Suddenly, I was in the world of <unk>
And not a lot of people can say that his first work was from queen of beauty of beauty as <unk> but I know it.
I also met the <unk> of the <unk> of all of the <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>
But more important than all that, I met my best friends of that community.
In 2001 my father, who had moved to San Francisco, called me and told me that I took my head from the green card that I could go to the United States.
I was <unk>
I told my mother, yes, I'm <unk> I'm <unk> I'm <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a queen of <unk>
But then two weeks later, I called him and said, "You know that if you go to the United States you can change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was everything I needed to.
My mom asked me to give him two <unk> to my name for my name for my name <unk>
She also came up with me when I asked him at Thailand at the top of the 19, and I asked them to <unk>
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities of Thailand would make the most sophisticated surgeries and <unk>
In that then in the United States, it was necessary to be the surgery before the name and the <unk>
So in 2001 I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the license for the name of the name of the name of the <unk>
It was a very nice time.
For some people, their attention means to be able to drive or be able to get a <unk> but for me it was the license to live, to know <unk>
And suddenly, my hope was you saw <unk> <unk>
I felt that I could take my dream and go back to New York City, and be a <unk>
Many of them are so <unk>
I think in this woman of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman from New York who <unk> she lived in his true, but he would go back to his life.
So for many of my community, that is the reality that they were living in that they were living in the world.
Our blood rates are eight times higher than the rest of the rest of the population.
All of the <unk> <unk> we do a global <unk> for the <unk> <unk> of <unk>
I'm in this stage because of a long story of people who <unk> and put up on the <unk>
These are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Today, at this same time, I'm going to go back from the <unk>
I can't keep living my truth and just for me.
I want to do the best to help the other people to live their true truth without <unk>
I'm here to show you so that some day no day no day no longer a <unk> of 20 <unk>
My real truth took me to take what I'm asking.
What would you do?
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.               -- a question for you.
<unk> <unk>
And my parents to my parents today today to my family, who are very excited about it.
I remember all the times that I've been working with young women who have <unk> and some times, when I asked me and told me what their parents couldn't do, I took the phone, I took my mom and said, "You can call this <unk>
Some of the other things were not just identity identity -- that's what is in the middle of what we are, right?
And I mean, all of us have been able to make a gender <unk> and what I'm trying to do is put on the table, the subject that some of the time that some of them should be a space and that should have a space that would allow people to be with parents, with <unk>
The <unk> <unk> is <unk> compared to the <unk> <unk> <unk>
There's still a lot of work to do.
It should be <unk>
It should be space for curiosity and how to do questions, and I hope that all of you are my <unk>
KS: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
In many societies, <unk> and vulnerable, to parents usually know about their children, but I'm one of the few parents who are known for her daughter and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started their campaign for education, their rights in the <unk> and when they <unk> their efforts in 2011, the National Embassy of peace, was made very <unk> a very popular girl in his country.
Before that, it was my daughter, but now I'm his dad.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you take a look at the history of humanity, the story of the women is the story of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk>
You see, in traditional societies, just from the beginning, when the president was a girl, her birth didn't get it.
It's not for his father, nor his mother.
The neighborhood -- the neighborhood -- the mother of mother and nobody would be <unk>
And a mother picks up a lot of a <unk>
When it comes to light to the first child, the first daughter, the first daughter, the first daughter, <unk>
When the second day at the second daughter, <unk> and, with the hope of a child, when I <unk> her third daughter, she feels guilty as a <unk>
Not only the mother said, but the child would just <unk> when it was a <unk>
At the age of five years old, when I should go to school, it gets home and high school in the <unk>
Until the age of 12 years old, I have a good life.
It can be <unk>
It can play with your friends in the street, and you can move through the streets like a <unk>
But when you go in college, when you spend 13 years old, you get the <unk> of your house without a <unk>
It's <unk> the four walls of his home.
It's not a bad person.
It turns out that his father and his brothers and his brothers and her family, and if they would take the code of that of course -- the code of that of of the course of the course of the course of the course of the course of the course of the course of the course of the course of the course of the course of the course of the
And it's interesting that this of us -- it's not just the life of a <unk> it's also the life of the family members of the family.
So this brother, <unk> the <unk> of his life and happiness from his sisters at the name of the course of the course of the course of the course of Africa.
And there are more <unk> <unk> <unk> which is called <unk> <unk>
It's supposed to be a good girl should be very <unk> very <unk> and very <unk>
It's <unk>
The model of a great girl should be <unk>
It's supposed to be <unk> and the decisions of his father and his mother and the decisions of the rest of the time, even if they don't understand.
If the <unk> with a man who doesn't like or if the <unk> with a kid with a man who doesn't want to be a <unk> of <unk>
If the <unk> very young, it has to be a <unk>
Now, the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And what happens to the <unk>
In the words of a <unk> "The <unk> and then it gives light to more kids and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson from <unk> to his daughter and the same lesson, of her kids.
And this vicious cycle continues to be a <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters and sisters when he was born <unk> and for the first time, trust me, I don't like <unk> but when I was there and I looked at their eyes, believe me, I felt incredibly <unk>
And a lot of <unk> I thought in his name, and I was fascinated by a <unk> <unk> of freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> of <unk> and he called my daughter so for him for it.
But when I asked me all of them, they were all men, and I took my picture, and I put them up on my name, and I wrote <unk>
And when she got four years and a half and a half and a half and a half years ago.
You know, why should I mention the <unk> of a girl in a <unk>
Yes, I have <unk> <unk>
You can put it in Canada in Canada in Canada in the United States, in many countries, but in the poorest countries, in rural societies, is a great event for life to be <unk>
<unk> in a school means the recognition of his identity and his name for her name.
A <unk> to the school means that it has come in the world of dreams and grandchildren where it can explore their potential for their <unk>
I have five friends, and no one of them could go to school, and they would be <unk> two weeks before, when they were <unk> and was in the middle of the family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my friends.
And the reason it was that I had never seen the names of my sisters in any <unk>
That was the reason why the value was going to my child loved my mother.
What my father couldn't do was to give my sisters not to their daughters, I thought he had to be a <unk>
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the <unk> of my friends.
The <unk> to sit with me when my friends came to <unk>
The experimenter to go to different <unk>
And all of these values, I've been trying to convince you in your life.
And this was not only for it, just for <unk>
I've got all these good values in my school to girls and kids in the <unk>
I used education for <unk>
And I asked my daughters, who taught students to forget the lesson of <unk>
They taught students to forget the lesson called <unk> <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters and sisters and sisters for more rights for women and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we found out with a phenomenon new.
It was lethal for human rights and, in particular, for women of women.
It's called <unk> <unk>
That means one of the most successful women in the women in all major activities and social activities and social problems.
Hundreds of schools were born.
So the girls are going to go to school.
And women were forced to use <unk> and they stopped getting to <unk>
The musicians were <unk> teenage girls, and the musicians were <unk>
<unk> millions, but a few <unk> and it was scary to have those people who killed and <unk> when you talk about your <unk>
It's really <unk>
In the last 10 years, I got up and raised by the right to education to education to education to education.
He wrote a family for the <unk> he gave him her same way for the New York Times, and I spoke in every platform that I would have.
And his voice was the hardest one.
It was <unk> like a <unk> in the world.
And that was the reason that the Taliban couldn't tolerate their campaign and the nine years of the 2012, <unk> <unk> in the head.
It was one day for my family and for me.
The world became a large hole in the world in the world.
As my daughter was <unk> between life and death, I would go back to my <unk> <unk> for what happened to my daughter, to your mother.
And he said, "For me, he said, "Why don't you <unk>
<unk> the cause of <unk>
And so your life in game is because of the cause of peace, and because of the cause of education, and your daughter was inspired by you, and it would be <unk>
Both were in the right way and God <unk>
And these few words <unk> a lot to me, and I didn't start to ask this question.
When I was in the hospital, and I was in the hospital, and I had migraine headaches from my head because his facial <unk> was a <unk> I used to see a dark shadow that was <unk> by my mind.
But my daughter would never be <unk>
It used to be <unk> "I'm okay with my smile -- and with the <unk> in my head.
And so I'm going to give you a little <unk>
It was a <unk> for us, and we would get rid of it.
<unk> brothers and sisters have learned about it, how to get in the most difficult moments and I'm happy to share with you that despite the rights of children and women, it's like any girl in 16 years.
<unk> when they don't just get their <unk>
They fight with their brothers, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me to tell me about how much special in my apartment, which has been so busy to <unk> so <unk> and <unk>
I say, I don't ask me what I did.
<unk> what I did I did not <unk>
I don't cut your wings and that's everything that is all out.
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
I was <unk> of the brain about 18 years ago, and, from that day, the science of the brain has become a passion for me.
I am a engineering engineering design.
And I want to tell you that I recently came up with a group of Google, where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> the <unk> of Google -- but all the work that I'm talking today about here is about the science of the brain, which I would talk about here with you.
Having said this, there is a stigma when you go to a brain.
You might be as smart as smart or good.
This is not just as a like this, you will go back to the <unk>
And after the <unk> I was a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't dark matter but it was the <unk> part of the center that creates important <unk> and <unk> <unk>
It was after the operation, I had to decide what about a dozen more than a dozen <unk> <unk> every day, because if I didn't take nothing, I would die in a few months.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide about the combinations of the combinations and put them out of them, and try to go back to my life.
Over once I've saved my little <unk>
But luckily, I have a soul of <unk> so I decided to try to get the <unk> <unk> because there is no one map that says to me in <unk>
I began to try with them with different <unk> and I was surprised by looking at how small changes in the doses that I had, my sense of who I was me, my way of thinking, my behavior with the <unk>
A particularly <unk> case for a few months, I call doses and chemical <unk> for a man of <unk> and I ended up looking at how I started.
I was always <unk> I thought all the time in sex, and I believed that it was the most smart person around the world, and --  -- of course, many times in the past I've known several types of things, or maybe some <unk> versions of <unk>
It turned out like a <unk>
But my great surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was <unk> a lot of <unk> to make a problem that I had to the front, and I simply wouldn't be like this.
So I couldn't do it.
I did my <unk>
But I think that experience gave me a new appreciation about men and about men and about what they have to do, from so on.
And what it was about to get to the <unk> those hormones and neurotransmitters and everything, it was to bring my intelligence after the disease and the <unk> my creative thinking, my flow of ideas.
And I also think about images, and that became my point of reference point -- how do I do these amazing images to create <unk> my ideas, if you will, <unk> new ideas and <unk>
This kind of thoughts is not <unk>
<unk> like <unk> <unk> and <unk> look at things like this.
We thought the images and ideas were the same thing.
Today, there are people who have this idea, and there are lots of arguments about how it works in the history of how the history works for me -- for most of us, the real images are critical for <unk>
So after several years, I would be able to find the point right and I have a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> actually <unk> very well and <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to take it very fast and look at these images of my mind on the screen of the computer.
So you can imagine what if a theater paper would be able to use their imagination only to drive the world that has to be <unk>
Or if a musician could get the music of his <unk>
There are incredible possibilities with this, like the way people creative people can get to the speed of light.
And the truth is that, the only difficulty to achieve this is simply to increase the resolution of our brain systems.
So let me show you why I think we are pretty close to this with two experiments that have been done by two groups in <unk>
Both of them used technology to be able to make a <unk> image of artificial <unk> to represent the brain, here you can see the brain made by <unk> <unk> and their colleagues of <unk>
So the column on the left shows the <unk> of a person who looks a image.
<s> The <unk> in the middle of the brain shows the brain of that exact same kind of image.
The column on the right is he created the content of the central column of the upper left -- you see that the difference is almost <unk>
This is <unk> in many different individuals with a lot of different images with lots of different types of things.
The difference between looking at an image and imagine to see that same image is almost <unk>
Now, let me tell you another question. This is from the laboratory of Jack <unk> in Berkeley, China.
They were able to convert brain waves into physical form.
And this is what it is.
In this experiment, he showed the number of hours of YouTube from YouTube as it would be <unk> their brains to create a great <unk> of the brain of the brain of the brain.
And then I showed you a film with new images new new new animals, and as a new <unk> new <unk>
So the computer using only the brain brain brain is to show what it looks like the person was <unk>
On the right you can see the <unk> of the computer, and on the left, the video that came out of it.
This was left <unk>
We're okay about it. We're okay about it.
We just need to improve the future.
And now, remember that when you see an image and when you imagine that same picture, it creates the same <unk> it creates the same thing.
This took place with the <unk> systems of greater resolution available today, and their resolution is as a billion times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase the resolution for a thousand times to get a more <unk>
How do we <unk>
There are many techniques to do this.
One is to open the skull and put them up in the <unk>
I didn't give me the <unk> for the <unk>
Many of these are <unk> new techniques for images, even I was <unk> with the recent result of <unk> first -- first we should ask the next question, this technology will be the end of it.
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get greater resolution is with <unk> <unk> but at this point, the more <unk> only offer small improvements in the center are not about for thousands as well.
I propose this idea: instead of <unk> we do better than that.
We can create much more complex structures with obesity, slightly different than doing a <unk>
And why did this happen?
In the last few years, a huge amount of effort in video games were to make very big, right?
However, most of the recent breakthroughs in the recent solutions, and bright and brilliant <unk> in <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> and <unk> of <unk> in the <unk> systems.
At the same time, instead of a magnetic field that would be <unk> complex patterns of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
So to combine the magnetic patterns with the mathematical patterns of the processing processing patterns, we can increase the information that can extract in a single <unk>
In addition, we can then split into layers of the structure of the brain structure and memory to create the increase in the thousands that we need to use the increase in the thousands we need.
By using the <unk> we should be able to measure not only the blood pressure but the <unk> and <unk> that I've mentioned and perhaps even the dark activity -- this is the <unk>
We're going to be able to get our ideas in a direct way.
You can imagine if we could go out of the language and get directly through the <unk>
What we would be <unk>
And how we learn to deal with the truths of human thinking.
You were thought that the Internet is a big thing.
These are great questions.
It would be <unk> as a tool to make our skills of thinking and communication.
Certainly, this same tool could take the cure for Alzheimer's and mental illness.
We have a few more choices that we open this image.
In fact, they would be a year in five or 15 years.
It's hard to imagine that you have a lot more.
We have to learn how to take this step further.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Let me talk about this night about <unk> and not in a traditional sense, not just the <unk>
I think we all have <unk>
His self might tell you a person for the first time or tell someone who is happy, or tell someone that it has cancer, or any other conversation that you have in your life.
All I'm going to do is a hard conversation and even though our issues can vary <unk> the experience of I've lived and have come back from that sort of thing.
It was fear, and we didn't like, and it should be <unk> and it should be <unk>
A lot of years ago, I was working on <unk> <unk> <unk> a restaurant in the city, and I had to take a lot of the intensity of the intensity of the intensity of the intensity of the intensity of the intensity of <unk>
And being <unk> from the <unk> of my short run, and I would have <unk> my head was a little bit, I would ask you because a child would be <unk> or <unk>
And I took a certain silence on the table, and it took a sense of it.
<unk> my name is a little more, and I took my coffee with a <unk>
And the father <unk> the newspaper and the mother <unk> a little bit look at her mother.
But I don't say nothing, and you get out of it.
And I came to the point that every time I was going to a place where there was a child between three and ten years ago.
And that is a very powerful feeling of <unk>
So I realized that the next time I would say something.
And they did that conversation hard to do it.
So after a few weeks, came from a few weeks ago.
You're a guy or a <unk> or a <unk>
A familiar, but this time I was ready and I was going to go back to the issues of women in the <unk>  I had the quotes of Betty <unk>
The quotes of <unk> <unk>
Even a little bit of the truth that I <unk> <unk> that <unk>
And so I went back and I went back and I sat down and my name was a little girl with a <unk> <unk> which is not a challenge for a <unk> <unk> just a child with a child with a girl or <unk>
And so I went back to the lab, again, I came out of it, and I said, "Hey, I know that this is something <unk>
I have the short hair like the one of a child, and I see clothes of a child, but I'm a girl, and you know, as you like to use a <unk> <unk> and sometimes you like to use a <unk>
Now, I'm more from the kind of girl in a <unk>
And that little girl I looked at me, and said, "My favorite video is <unk> and it has a <unk>
I can give you a <unk>
And that was exactly what it was going to happen.
What happens with the <unk> that <unk> <unk>
It was the hardest conversation of all that never ever ever ever seen.
And by <unk> because the girl of the <unk> and I, both and I, both of the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some <unk> in my life, and yes, my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside of the dark, you can't know what color is the <unk>
And you just know how a brain feels living in a <unk>
This is how my truth is not different from you or at you or at the time.
And I asked them to give you 100 reasons why you go out of my feeling that it was more difficult to go out of the <unk> but this is the <unk>
The hard thing is it's hard to do it.
Who can tell me that I'm going to tell someone that they have died in high school is more difficult to tell that it has been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story that this story is more hard to tell your son about five years that you go to <unk>
There's no more hard thing there is no longer the hard thing.
We have to leave it to make sure that we are hard to understand what is hard to do for another person to make a better person to make better or worse in relationship to our argument, and we should only feel empathy because we all live in something hard.
In some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and you can do it for more security or at least more security than the other side of the planet.
But I'm here to tell you that no matter what you're made of your walls, a place to do this is a place to do it.
Thank you.  Imagine if 20 years ago.
I, I had a line of <unk> a rock and shoes of <unk>
It wasn't the <unk> <unk> in order to fight any child in four years that would go to the <unk>
I was <unk> by the fear, <unk> in a corner of my hometown -- my grandmother, who was gay, and how you move only a skeletal is the most compelling thing I ever had.
My family, my friends, my friends, who I've spent my entire life trying to be <unk> and now the world was going to be a <unk>
I was burning the pages of a <unk> that we've all followed for so much time, but if you don't look at that <unk>
One of my favorite <unk> was in the middle of my family.
It was the first time that many of them knew that it was gay, and when I was gay, I was gay, and when I was gay, I was gay, and I was in my black <unk> I walked around the table, and I finally came to one where the friends of my parents, people who knew that they were the friends of my parents, and I was <unk>
And after I talk a moment, one of the women <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And the battle of gay marriage had <unk>
<unk> once we were in the <unk>
"Well, yes, the truth is that we have friends in San Francisco.
"Well, we have never been there, but we have heard that it's <unk>
You know, you know, you know what?
It's very good and has never been talking about having <unk> <unk>
So what is your program of <unk>
Our program is Craig and Grace <unk>
And you know who you <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, a woman, but in wait about to show her support for I would have to know that I was out of my side, finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband uses <unk> <unk>
And I had a chance at that time, like the <unk> of <unk> <unk>
<unk> might have been easy to tell where it felt <unk>
It's not very hard to find out and realizing the fact that they were <unk>
And what one other thing you can ask someone, but <unk> is <unk>
If you're going to be authentic with someone, you have to be prepared for the authentic feeling that <unk>
This is like the conversations that are hard to keep up without being my favorite point there.
And I want to tell anyone that I have <unk>
But I'm going to go back, and I do what I like to call the three principles of <unk> <unk>
Now, please look at this through the English perspective, but understand that what it means to go out of any <unk> is essentially the same.
Number one: No <unk>
<unk> <unk>
And that girl in the coffee didn't have to go back to the <unk>
If you want someone to be <unk> the other you should know that they are also <unk>
Number two: (Audience: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
If you know that they're gay, lesbian, <unk>
If you say your parents who might be gay, they would take the hope that it could change.
I don't give you a sense of <unk> <unk>
And number three, and more <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
They communicate their truth.
It was not <unk>
And some of you can go to <unk> <unk> for what they have done, but it has never been <unk> for what they are.
And yes, you might be able to be <unk> but that thing in them, not in you -- not in you -- not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not the <unk>
That is the story of them, but not about you.
The only story that matters is that you want to be a <unk>
So the next time you find in a dark dark way, a <unk> must know that we all have been there before.
And you can feel very carefully, but I don't know.
Thank you very much.
<unk> what is that?
If we look at the story of how it has seen intelligence -- a viable example has been the famous quote of <unk> <unk> which is the question of whether a machine can think about the question of whether a car can <unk>
When <unk> <unk> he wrote this as a metaphor to the <unk> of computing like Alan <unk>
And so, a few years ago, I took a program to try to understand the real physical mechanisms of my life.
<unk> <unk>
We first start with a positive experiment, and we first start with this.
So imagine that it's about a human race that doesn't know anything about biology -- not about the Earth -- not from the Earth -- but they have incredible telescopes, and they have incredible telescopes, so they have incredible telescopes, so you can see the Earth during millions of years.
And you can see a very cool effect there.
And of course, as a <unk> we know that the reason it would be that we are trying to get ourselves to our future.
We're trying to avoid a <unk>
But if you are in an ideal race that doesn't know anything about this, which doesn't have any concept of intelligence on the Earth, you can see the physical theory that explain how, until a certain time in the time, the asteroids that we put on the surface of a planet.
And so I would say that this is the same question that the physical nature of music is <unk>
So in this program that took a few years ago, I looked at a variety of issues through science, through various <unk> that <unk> I think, to a single specific mechanism of <unk>
In <unk> for example, there has been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be the development of intelligence and, in particular, for developing states -- to developing the development of the global states that we <unk>
Finally, in <unk> <unk> has been a variety of studies that have been trying to harness the skills of robots to maximize the future freedom of action with the end of doing complex things.
And so, taking all these different themes and <unk> together, I asked him for a few years: There's a underlying mechanism for intelligence that we can extract from all these different <unk>
There's only a equation for <unk>
And I think the answer is what you're seeing is probably the fastest equivalent to a <unk> and <unk> <unk> for intelligence that I have seen before.
So what you're seeing here is a statement that intelligence is a force --  that it acts with the end of maximize the future of the future of information.
It has to maximize the future freedom of action, or keep the old choices with a <unk> force with the diversity of the future of the future of the future of human nature.
In a few words, the intelligence of intelligence doesn't like <unk>
The intelligence is trying to maximize the future freedom and keep the choices in the future.
And so you have to know that this equation, is natural <unk> What can you do with this? What can you do with this?
What do you <unk>
<unk> the level of intelligence is <unk>
<unk> <unk>
So I'm going to show you a video that I think to show some of the amazing applications of this simple problem.
<unk> research in cosmology research has suggested that the universes that produce more <unk> or <unk> during their life should have the most sophisticated conditions for human beings like us.
But what happens if that connection to that connection between entropy and intelligence -- a more <unk> relationship to <unk>
What happens if complex behavior is not only connected with the biology production, but it actually takes directly to <unk>
To find out, we've developed a software for software called <unk> designed to maximize the production production, in any system where you can find out where it is.
In fact, <unk> could take multiple tests of artificial intelligence from human intelligence games and even earn money for free, and all of that without any of them would have <unk>
Here are some examples of <unk> in action, in action.
At the end of a human hand, there are no <unk> here we see in <unk> <unk> put a <unk> using a <unk>
This behavior is really remarkable in part because we never gave them to <unk> a <unk>
It just decided to get the <unk> <unk>
So this ability will have applications for robotics -- and technology technologies of human health.
So this capacity of tools will have applications in artificial manufacturing and <unk>
But also, like some other animals can cooperate with other animals, and the same time in the same time to liberate the food, here we see that <unk> can make a version of the <unk> model of that <unk>
This capacity of cooperation has interesting implications for economic growth, and in a variety of other ways.
<unk> is capable of a variety of <unk>
So for example, here we see a game of <unk> against itself, <unk> their potential for the game for the <unk>
So here we see <unk> <unk> new connections in a social network, where the friends are <unk> constantly and stays with success and <unk>
This same capacity of <unk> also has applications in healthcare, in healthcare, in energy and design.
So here we see <unk> to organize the routes of a multinational fleet discovering with success and using the <unk> <unk> to expand the world's deepest level of the Atlantic to the <unk>
In the same way, <unk> is capable of being defined by problems in defense or <unk>
Finally, here we see that we are going to be able to find out and make a strategy of <unk> <unk> in a series of <unk> <unk> <unk> the active ones under their <unk>
So this ability to risk <unk> applications in medicine, and in fact, we have a <unk>
Alex <unk> What they've seen is that a variety of human behaviors like the use of tools like the use of tools and social cooperation -- all of the <unk> all of a single <unk> that leads to a system to maximize their future freedom of information.
Now, here is a deep <unk>
Let's go back at the beginning of the term <unk> <unk> -- there were always the concept that if we could, we would have a <unk> <unk>
The machines are <unk>
One of the biggest problems of this work is that perhaps all of these decades, we've had all the concept of <unk>
It's not that the machines are going to become smart and then <unk> and we try to take it from the world.
It is all the opposite, that the <unk> of all the future of the future is a very fundamental principle that the intelligence of intelligence is actually going directly to take control, rather than being at the same time.
The other important consequence is the pursuit of the future.
So I often say to me, how is it going to look at goals of this kind of <unk>
My equivalent to that statement to go to the descendants of the descendants to help them build <unk> or to help us understand human intelligence -- is the <unk> intelligence should be as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and avoid the constraints in their own future.
Thank you. Thank you.
We're in a <unk> point in human history, something between the <unk> of stars and lose the planet that we call <unk> <unk>
Even in the last few years, we've created a lot of our knowledge of how it works in the context of the universe.
The mission NASA discovered thousands of different planets that orbit around other stars, which tells the Earth is only one between the thousands of millions of planets from our solar system.
This is a space telescope that measures the intensity of stars when the planets go across in front of them, and again, a little bit of that light that we need.
Now, the data collected by Kepler showing the colors of the planets in the way that there are between them and their star star and its <unk>
And so, this helps us understand if these planets are small and <unk> as the planets of our solar system, and also the amount of light that they get from their <unk>
At the time, this gives us clues about if these planets that we find are <unk> or not.
Unfortunately, as we are finding this <unk> of <unk> potentially <unk> our own planet is <unk> under the weight of consciousness.
Last year it was the fastest <unk>
And <unk> and ice ice that have been with us since we have been in a matter of decades.
So these environmental changes that we have caused a global scale have come together quickly our ability to alter their <unk>
But I'm not a scientific scientist in the weather, not <unk>
But we study the world's world's world's <unk> the rest of the rest of finding places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
You might say that I'm looking for bacteria in the developing world.
Now, as someone very interested in search of life in the universe I can say that the more you look at planets like the Earth Earth, most of our own planet.
Every one of these new worlds looks at a comparison between the planet just discovered and the planets that we know from our solar system.
Just take our attention.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a bit more far further from the Sun, it can be a <unk> world, showing this for a mission as a mission as the <unk>
In fact, it is possible that Mars has been in the past and, in part of that is why we studied so much to Mars.
Our <unk> like the <unk> and the <unk> and the surface of the origins of the life of life as we know it.
The satellites that <unk> like the <unk> like the <unk> <unk> take samples from the atmosphere and try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
<unk> companies now offer not only a little <unk> but also the chance to live in Mars in Mars.
But even though all of these images will come up to us, we remind ourselves of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with <unk> ideas, and <unk> compared to the Earth, Mars is a pretty terrifying place to do it.
You take the result of the <unk> areas of our planet that we still have to <unk> the <unk> places in comparison with Mars.
Even in the most remote parts of the Earth and the air is cool and full of oxygen from our forest forest to thousands of miles away from it.
I worry that this experience by the <unk> of Mars and other planets, and other planets get a big and sad and sad and sad -- the belief that Mars is waiting for this <unk> of the only planet that we know is that it is truly exciting.
And so I like to change exploration exploration -- I'm in deep forbid, with this idea.
There's a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars will be there for the humanity of humanity is as imagine that the captain of the Sun will have a place later on the <unk>
But the goals of exploration are going to explore and organize and land it doesn't exist.
No, they are actually faces of the same <unk> the goal of understanding and improve life in the future.
The extreme environments here in our world look like this.
You only find more about home.
If we can understand how to create and keep <unk> spaces in different areas, maybe we can meet the need to preserve our environment and go beyond our environment and go beyond that.
I'll leave you with an experiment -- the paradox of <unk>
A lot of years ago, the physical <unk> I asked you to have the universe that our universe has existed since a lot of time, and hope that there are many planets in this universe, we should have found any of the existence of life until now.
Well, where are we?
Well, a solution to the paradox of prevalence is that when the civilizations become good enough to be able to look at the world on the stars, lose the notion of the important thing that is protecting the origin of the planets that we need.
This is <unk> to think that only <unk> <unk> will save us from ourselves, but <unk> <unk> and <unk> can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to put into the environments of Mars for the human presence -- then we should be able to overcome the task even more easy to preserve the world's <unk>
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
And a few years ago, I was <unk> my own home.
And as I was in the door, you know, looking at my face, I realized I didn't have the <unk>
In fact, I could see the window that were at the table at the table, where there were <unk>
So fast I tried to open all the other doors and everything, and all they were very <unk>
I thought to be a <unk> at least I had my cell phone, but at nighttime, a <unk> might be a lot of time in it, and I did it.
I couldn't go home from my friend of St. <unk> and I had a flight early to Europe at the next morning and <unk> out of my <unk> and <unk>
They wanted to stop ready but sure that they don't even lose a <unk> to a half night, so I thought, even though they were being <unk>
I am <unk> and I know a little bit about how the brain works under stress.
<unk> <unk> which is the heart rate of the heart rate and <unk> the thinking.
And when I came to the <unk> in the background, I realized that I didn't have my dad.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without <unk>
And I started asking myself, if there was something that I could do, systems that I could put in your place, you would be <unk>
Or at least if we happen to be able to make sure that the likelihood that the probability that it is a <unk>
So I got to think about that, but until a month after my thoughts were not <unk>
I was raised with my colleague Danny <unk> <unk> The Nobel Prize and a little <unk> I talked about the window, and, of course there were forgotten my <unk> and Danny taught me that I had been doing something called <unk>
This is something that he had learned from the British poet <unk> who had written about this a few years before, known as the <unk>
They all know what's the <unk>
Every time there is a disaster, a team of experts comes and tries to figure out what it came from.
In <unk> as it explains -- you look forward and tries to figure out all the things that might go wrong, so then try to figure out what you can do to avoid that things are going to make things happen.
So what I want to talk with you is a few things that we can do in the shape of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> other things are so important.
I'm going to start with the <unk>
On the home, you get a place for the things that you lose <unk>
This sounds of common sense, and it is, but there are a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how it works in how it works.
There's a structure in the brain called <unk> which has evolved, over thousands of years ago, to make a location of the location of the important things, where the fish, where the fish, the <unk> trees, where they live in the tribes and <unk>
The Earth is the part of the brain that comes in in the <unk> of London in New York.
This is the part of the brain that allows them to find their <unk>
And if you ask yourself, if someone really did the experiment, you would get the sense of <unk> and even so you could find your <unk>
They don't use the <unk> but the hippocampus, that mechanism, so that the brain uses to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move too much, not as good for things that you can move on.
This is the reason to lose one of the car, read about reading and <unk>
So in a <unk> a place to give them a place to go back to the door, maybe a <unk>
So for her to be a <unk>
So for her writing <unk> a <unk> in the morning.
If you get a place and you're <unk> with it your stuff will always be there when you get out of the <unk>
What happens with the <unk>
Take your cell phone a picture of your credit card <unk> <unk> <unk> for them to know that they're in the <unk>
If these things are lose or <unk> it can change the <unk>
These are some of the things that are more <unk>
Remember, when you're under stress, your brain protects the <unk>
The <unk> is limited, and you can do it.
So part of the practice of <unk> is to recognize that according to stress -- we will not be at the best time, and you have to put the systems in your home.
And there are perhaps no more <unk> situation than when you go to a medical decision for a medical decision to make a medical decision for a medical decision for a <unk>
And at some point, we will all be in that situation, of having a very important decision about the future of our medical care or the <unk> to help them to help them with a <unk>
And so I want to talk about that.
And I'm going to talk about a very simple question.
But this is a <unk> like a <unk> for all of us who are blind and actually to make sure it takes a lot of financial decisions and social decisions any kind of decision that we have to take from the <unk>
So suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I've got the result of the laboratory and the <unk> is a little <unk>
You all know that the high <unk> is based on a greater risk of heart disease, a heart rate of heart disease.
So you think that you have the high <unk> it's not the best -- then the doctor says, "I would like to <unk> a drug that will help reduce the <unk>
And perhaps one has already heard of the <unk> and knows that it's one of the biggest drugs in the world today, even if you know that you know that the <unk>
So you know, "Yes, <unk> <unk> <unk>
But there is a question that you should do then, a statistic that you should ask from the majority of doctors don't want to speak, and companies companies even need to go to <unk>
It's for <unk> the number required to <unk> the number required to <unk>
And what is it that <unk> <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or permission to a surgery in any medical procedure in any medical procedure before they will help a person.
And it should be to think about what kind of statistic of <unk>
The number has to be a <unk>
My doctor didn't get me <unk> something if it wasn't going to <unk>
But actually, the medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not necessarily about the doctor, and if it's guilt of the scientists as I was talking about.
We haven't understood very well the mechanisms that we need.
But 95 percent of the drugs that 90 percent of the drugs are actually about 30 percent of the people.
So the number we need to try to deal with the most complex <unk> what you think is going on.
How many people have to be able to get before we help us to make a <unk>
Thank you.
This is according to the research researchers <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
But I was very lucky.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before to avoid a heart attack or a heart attack or another event <unk>
Now you might be thinking, "Well, one probability in 300 of my <unk>
Why don't we <unk> <unk> the recipe for all of these <unk>
But then you have to ask for one another, and it is, <unk> of the effects of <unk> Right? Right?
So for this drug in particular, the side effects produce on five percent of the patients, they give them five percent of their patients.
And those include things like <unk> pain pain and <unk> pain pain -- but now you know, <unk> five percent is not very likely that I'm going to take the <unk>
But a little bit later.
remember that according to stress don't think about <unk>
So you think about how you <unk> this with the time, so you don't have to make the performance chain, in the <unk>
300 people take the <unk>
So you have 15 times more likely to go out of the drug that will help you get the <unk>
I don't say they should take the <unk>
I just say that you should have this conversation with your mother.
The medical choice is <unk> is part of the beginning of a <unk>
We have right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about if you want to take the risks or not.
Maybe you're thinking that I've released this number of power in the value of the crash, but actually this number needed to try to try it is quite <unk>
For the surgery that is done in the biggest men in the United States, <unk> of cancer, the number necessary to try to try to deal with it.
So this is 23 surgeries for a person who has <unk> which has <unk>
And the side effects in that case, they produce at 50 percent of their patients.
Those include <unk> <unk> or dysfunction <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you have lucky enough, and it is one of the 50 percent effects of <unk> a year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think before the questions that you can do, the conversation is going to go back to it.
You don't have why you make all this in your pocket.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because it has a choice many times, you want a more stable life than pain, or a more long life that might have a lot of pain to the <unk>
These are the things that they speak and think about now, with her family and their loved ones.
You can change it in the heat of the moment, but at least you are trained in this kind of thinking.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> and one of the things that happens at that moment is that it takes a lot of <unk>
There's an evolutionary reason for this. There's an evolutionary question.
In the face of a cookie, it's not necessary for the <unk> or the <unk> or the <unk> or the system, because if the body is spending energy in those things, you will be able to get the copy of the <unk> so none of it is.
Unfortunately, one of the things that is going on in the window for those times is the rational idea as Danny <unk> and his colleagues have <unk>
So we have to be able to think about the future of this sort of way.
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we are all <unk>
We are all going to be in <unk>
So the idea is to think about the future how to be those <unk> to put the systems in the place that will help save damage, or to avoid the things bad things in the first place.
And I went back to the night, when I came back from my journey, my contractor gave me a <unk> of combination with the door, with a key to the door of the door of the door to the same way.
And I have to admit that I still have a lot of letters that I haven't raised and lots of messages from email that I haven't seen.
So I don't really go very fast, but I see the organization like a <unk> process, and I'm going to go back to it.
Thank you. Thank you.
Recently <unk> <unk> is my favorite piece of music -- <unk> <unk>
It means to play <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument and you see a <unk> in the <unk> you need to touch more <unk>
Two <unk> even more <unk>
Four <unk> extremely <unk>
This is my drawing of a tree of <unk> there is no matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> may have never seen a full <unk>
That is my definition of <unk> a very dark sound sound of <unk>
I would like to share a bit about the story of the history of the American government, the <unk> of a bit of my own story.
The language of <unk> came out during the 1970s, and in the course of the time, it became a good language, and it was the language that we know as <unk>
So it has a story about 200 years ago.
I was born <unk> and he taught me to believe that sound wasn't a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
But now I realize that it's not true for you.
The sounds are a very important part of my life, I really are in my mind every day.
As a person <unk> who lives in a <unk> world, is as if I lived in a busy country, following their rules, <unk> behaviors and norms without <unk>
So how do you understand the <unk>
Well, I look at how people relate and respond to the <unk>
People are like my <unk> and <unk> the <unk>
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sound, and I've seen how people <unk>
So I've been working for example for example.
They don't <unk> <unk> <unk>
They don't do a lot of noise by eating out of the bag with <unk> <unk>
They don't <unk> and when you go back and when you go to the <unk> of the <unk>
All of this I call <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think of the sound tag on what the average person looks like.
I'm a <unk> <unk> of the <unk>
And I'm always waiting for <unk> the sound, about what is going to come to <unk>
From there, this <unk>
<unk>
<unk> for <unk>
<unk> for <unk>
You can see that the <unk> doesn't have notes on the walls of the lights.
That's because the lines already contain sound through the <unk> and we have to do it.
In <unk> <unk> the movement is equivalent to the <unk>
This is the signal for <unk> in the <unk>
A typical drone has five bits of light.
However, for me, do the self with my thumb -- so it doesn't feel good."
This is why in my drawings I just have four lines in the paper.
In the year I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic official there.
Before this time, I had worked like this.
During this summer, I went back and <unk> and <unk> and a different place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
In that moment, the sound was the tendency and that made me <unk>
There was no visual art, all of it was <unk>
Now the sound has been in my inner art.
It is going to be a more <unk>
I realized that it doesn't have why it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the <unk>
I know so well that not only experiences through the <unk>
And I can do it in a way or a <unk> or even as an idea.
So I decided to educate the sound of sound and <unk> in my practice <unk>
And everything that had taught me in the sound of sound, I decided to take them and get them to <unk>
I started to create a new body of work.
And when I introduced him to the <unk> community, he was presented to the amount of support and attention that I would have.
I realized that sound is like money, the power, the power of the social problems.
On the bottom of my mind, I always felt that sound was <unk> it was something of a <unk> person.
And the sound is so powerful that I could get myself to myself, and my work would be <unk> or <unk>
I chose to <unk>
There's a massive culture around the language of <unk>
And just because I don't use my favorite voice to express the eyes of society is like I didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me as well as and become my mother.
And so I am able to be relevant in the history of life.
So in school, in the work and the institutions, work with many different <unk> of <unk>
And his voice becomes me in my voice, and it works.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and <unk>
Ironically, in order to ask them to <unk> their voices, I'm able to keep a direct form of value as like taking a loan with a very different <unk>
If you don't keep with this practice, I feel that it might be <unk> and you don't have any kind of value, social value and social problems.
So with sound as my new <unk> <unk> in the world of music.
And I was surprised to see the similarities between music and <unk>
So for example, a music story can't capture and express a bit about how it works.
And the same thing you can say of a concept in <unk>
The two are very <unk> and highly <unk> which means that changes can affect the meaning of the meaning of the <unk> like the <unk>
I would like to share with you a metaphor of the details, so that we understand better how it works.
So, imagine a <unk>
The <unk> <unk> in many different parameters -- different types of different things.
If you look at a different <unk> for every finger while you get the details, like the facial expression, the movement of the body, the shape of the body, the shape of your hand and so on, while you get the details, the English is a linear language, like <unk> just a <unk>
However, the <unk> is more like a <unk> you need 10 toes to express a concept of a single concept or a sense of <unk>
If you just sort of change the <unk> it would make a completely different meaning different.
The same thing with music is that the music in the middle of the <unk>
In <unk> by using these different parameters -- you can express different ideas.
For example, the signal would be <unk>
This is the sign of <unk>
I'm going to show you some examples.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
Oh, I'm going to show you <unk>
<unk> <unk>
What are you <unk>
Oh, <unk> <unk> <unk>
So I put me to thinking, and if I look at the <unk> through the <unk>
If I had to create a sign and put it up, one and again, it might be like a piece of visual music, a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the sign of <unk> the sun comes up and <unk>
This is the <unk>
If you will, and <unk> the speed is actually as a piece of music that a piece looks like.
All the day.
I feel that the same thing you can say about <unk> <unk> <unk>
The <unk>
This is all the night, in this picture.
And this led me to think about about three different types of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I feel that the third one has more <unk> than the other two <unk>
This represents the time in <unk> and how the distance in the body can express the changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is one hand, two <unk> is two -- the present is two -- the present is about and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body, and the past is in front of the body.
So the first example is <unk> a lot of interesting.
And then, <unk> <unk> and the final thing that is my favorite idea with a very specific idea at the time, <unk> a <unk>
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a specific rate of four times by <unk>
However, when I look at the word <unk> I think we automatically put in the same way.
Look at your hand hand, you know, <unk> hand right now.
We have the <unk> through the head and the <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
You can do it with this <unk>
All of the hands on your hands in your eyes.
Now we're going to do it so much in your head as the chest, something like <unk> <unk> or <unk>
Yeah, very good.
That means <unk> in the solar system.
The international system as a <unk> is a visual tool to help communicate in all the cultures, and the kinds of signs around the world.
The second thing I would like to show you is this for me to show you another again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in the <unk>
Now, the <unk> please, please, let me show you.
And another one.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
We're going to do three things.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
I'm going to do that.
Look at how the three signs are very similar to all of the <unk> and <unk> but they have very different ways.
It's amazing to see how the <unk> is alive and not, as the music.
However, today we live in a very <unk> world of <unk>
And just because the <unk> don't have sound, automatically it doesn't have any social value or social problems.
We have to start questioning what the social value and social value and allow them to get their own value, not just <unk>
And this might be a step to make a more <unk> society.
And perhaps people understand that there is no way to be <unk> to learn how to listen to music.
The <unk> is a rich <unk> and I would like to have the same thing.
I would like to take you to open your ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience our physical language and experience our physical language and experience our physical language and experience of our physical language and experience our physical language and experience of our physical language and experience our physical language and experience of our physical language and experience our physical language and experience our physical
And you might never know that until you don't know, they can be <unk>
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
<unk> <unk> No, I am my <unk>
As a child, my parents would say, "Oh, you know, <unk> everything, but then you have to go <unk>
The freedom it does for us to do it.
But my imagination took me all these little details, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a <unk> or a <unk> or a bubble of ignorance -- I must say, because the adults are encouraged to protect us from the great truth.
And I would go back to the best I learned that the adults were also <unk> and that they're not very good for the other ones.
Last time, now I'm an adult and a successful invention in the <unk> of New York City.
You don't have to wait a lot for my students to walk down the beach and make a lot of <unk>
So as a good citizens, <unk> the beaches, and no, it's not drinking water, and if it is, I don't know what it is.
And it's sad -- but today we have more than 80 percent of the oceans contain <unk>
It's kind of interesting.
And in the last decades, we've been coming up with these big oil and networks, to collect those bits of plastic to put them under the microscope, and the <unk> and <unk> this information on a map.
But there is a <unk> and it's very expensive and it also is very costly to use those <unk>
So along with my students, with the ages of six to 15 years ago, we decided to invent a better way to invent a better.
We've transformed our little <unk> in Hong Kong in New York.
We started building this <unk> of work with <unk> so that the children were very <unk> they could be <unk>
And I'll tell you the kids who are able to make electric tools and <unk>
I don't know.
Let's go back to <unk>
So the plastic and we reduce the size that we find in the ocean, which is very small, because of their <unk>
So this is <unk>
I leave the imagination of my <unk>
My work is to try to take the best ideas of every child and try to do it in something that we hope to work in something that we hope to live.
So we decided that instead of looking at pieces of plastic, just <unk> information.
By using the use of a robot, we took a picture of this <unk> children would eat a lot of things.
And then we created what we call <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We are so quick in the creation of <unk> that we end before we go before we go from <unk>
And you can see the light and cameras, and you can see it in a green robot that will move down the water, and the plastic that we have there, and this is the picture of the <unk>
We see the bits of plastic floating across the sensor while the computer on the floor of the ground process and measuring the size of every <unk> to get a measure of the amount of plastic in the water.
And I asked this invention to focus on a website called <unk> with the hope that someone would get it even more more.
So the cool thing in this project is that students saw a local problem, and they were trying to go back to the <unk>
And I started looking at my problem, but my students in Hong Kong are very well <unk>
You see the news, you get the Internet, and you put it with this image: <unk>
A child, perhaps less than 10 years ago, we got an oil oil only using the hands of the hands, in <unk> the forest -- the world's largest <unk>
They were very excited because this is the water that <unk> it is the water in which they <unk> the water where they were living in where they were.
You can see that the water is green, the dust, and the oil also means of brown and when all of you are very hard to see what is in the water.
But there's a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what you see in the water.
We built a first prototype of a <unk> which can be <unk> through all kinds of substances that produce different directions, which can help identify what you can help to identify what you have on your water.
And so this prototype with a sensor and we put it back into a <unk>
The great thing about this project is that beyond a local problem, or by looking at a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help others to help other kids.
And I started looking at a problem with <unk> I was forced to make a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little further away, maybe to deal with a harder problem, and also more close to me.
I'm a Japanese Japanese and half French and maybe remember that in 2011, there was an earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that it would be a number of brown waves called <unk> and those <unk> <unk> various cities in the United States.
Over 14 people died in a <unk>
It also gives the power plant plant, a nuclear power plant in the water.
And today, according to the reports of 300 tons still are still <unk> of the plant plant in the ocean floor.
Today, all the United States has to take away from pollution and <unk>
If we go to the United States, we can measure the radiation radiation in all of us.
But if you look at the map, it seems that the biggest part of the radiation disappeared from the <unk> <unk> and the majority of the time, it has to be <unk>
Well, the reality is a bit more complex than that.
And I've become <unk> every year since the accident and discovering with other scientists, the earth -- the river, the river, the river, and this time we wanted to take the children.
Of course, not <unk> parents don't do it.
But every night <unk> at the center of the <unk> here you see the use of it.
It might seem to seem to be the work we do, but they do it because they're going to have to live with <unk> all his life.
Along with them we collect the data from that day and we talk about what we were going to do, the <unk> and so on.
And to do this, we created a map of the region around the region of the spinal cord per year.
We created the map of <unk> <unk> to represent the real data in real time of <unk> and <unk> water to detect the <unk>
So what we were able to notice that the powder was <unk> from the top of the mountain to the <unk> <unk> and <unk> in the <unk>
It was a <unk>
But with the basis in this set up an expedition -- the fastest way to the central nuclear power to the <unk>
We're going to go back to three miles of nuclear power and the help of the help of the <unk> and the <unk> of the sea floor with a <unk> <unk> as we invented and <unk>
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a local problem with a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work in these different scales also with new technologies and very simple technologies.
But at the same time, it has been every time that because we've only been starting to measure the damage that we've done before.
We haven't even started to deal with the problems.
I wonder if we should take the leap and try to invent the best ways of doing all these things.
So the classroom became a little bit too small so so, we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong -- and we become the largest space dedicated to the social impact and the <unk>
It's in the center of Hong Kong -- and it's a place where we can work with wood, chemical <unk> a little bit of biology -- essentially you can build almost all over there.
It also is a place where the adults and children can play together, they can play together, they can play together.
This is a place where the dreams of children can become the help of adults, and where the adults can be able to be able to be able to go again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We asked them things like, we can invent the future of insulin resistance.
For example, for example, for example.
Or we can help in the mobility of the age of advanced age, expanding their tests in new vehicles in new vehicles in new vehicles, <unk>
The water and the <unk> are <unk> -- but the worst legacy we can leave our children are the ones that we can leave our children are <unk>
Now we can't help us protect the children of the horrible truth, because we need their imagination to invent the problems.
So citizens -- <unk> <unk> <unk> we need to make the next generation for the environment and people, and so that actually can actually do something about it.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Two <unk> <unk> two different cultures, two different physical design <unk>
One is made of thousands of bits of steel, the other one on the other side.
One of them is synthetic the other <unk>
And one of the things is about the environment, the other you know.
So one is designed by nature, the other one for it.
<unk> <unk> said that when he looked at the <unk> in Israel he saw a shape that struggle to be <unk>
The <unk> was only about <unk>
But human beings are not <unk>
They need it.
And in the most small units of life, the cells, we take all the information to each cell to work and to <unk>
The tools also have <unk>
At least from the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by <unk> and production in <unk>
The lines of comedy have <unk> a world that has <unk> the imagination of designers and architects and architects to think their objects as <unk> of parts of <unk> with different functions with different functions with different functions with different functions with <unk>
But you don't find <unk> <unk> in nature.
Think about the human body, for example, for example.
Our <unk> are <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The <unk> of the back are much smaller with small <unk>
So you also change the other primarily as you do, and yet it's the same way -- and yet it's the same <unk> there's no <unk>
This is a system that goes down, and it's a system that becomes <unk> by <unk>
Here's a dry screen that represents my view of the world -- the double <unk> of every designer and architect in working on the <unk> and the gene between the machine and the machine, between Henry Ford and Charles Smith and Charles <unk>
These two visions of the world in the world, my left and the right-hand side and <unk> it shows the two <unk> after me.
My job, in its more simple level, is to put these two views of the world, put out of it and go to the <unk>
You probably want to know what?
Why didn't we be that 10 or even five years ago.
We live in a very special moment, a very special moment in history, and where we have four thirds of designers that offers designers access to tools that we never had access to.
And in the intersection of these four fields, my team and I would argue that we were doing this.
Please know the minds and your hands of my friends and friends of my students.
We designed objects and tools and tools and tools from a large scale, like this artificial arm, with a <unk> of the middle of the diameter with a <unk> database that some day not very far from the <unk>
Here we have <unk> the <unk> a <unk> of the former architecture of the Arab architecture and it has created a screen where every <unk> is the shape of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explore the possibility to create a layer and a <unk> -- this was for a <unk> <unk> of Paris with <unk> <unk> -- it's like a second skin of a single <unk> <unk> in <unk>
Along with an engineer called <unk> <unk> this layer and <unk> 3D printing -- not <unk> between cells that show more objects like this.
So this helmet <unk> materials and <unk> in the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
This is also the resolution of a <unk> scanner <unk>
That designers have access to this high resolution and the instruments of <unk> allows them to design products that are <unk> not just the way of our bodies, but also the structure of our bodies, but also the structure of our lives.
So we've also designed a chair at the exact same way, and also that they use <unk> <unk>
And the teacher has, my aspiration went to nature to <unk> and design this pattern of the surface of the surface of <unk>
So you can see this surface surface right now, which vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> the pressure points in the human body.
His surface, as in nature, is not through the addition of a material or another <unk> but <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> property property <unk>
But it's the nature of <unk>
There are no parts in the <unk>
I didn't grew up in a Jewish town, but when I was young, my grandmother would tell me stories of the Bible <unk> and one of them got me to define a lot of what I was.
As she <unk> and the third day of the <unk> Lord <unk> to the Earth to grow a <unk> tree of <unk>
So for that first <unk> tree, there would be no difference between them and <unk> and <unk>
All the tree was a <unk>
Instead, the land did grow out trees with <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
The earth created a world done in <unk>
I often ask me to ask you to do the design if objects were made of a single <unk>
It was a better state of <unk>
So we look at the material -- the kind of material of the tree of the tree, and we found that we found it.
The second <unk> on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons of tons that produce every year for organisms like shrimp, <unk> and <unk>
We think that if we can <unk> their <unk> we could generate <unk> structures in a single way.
So that's what we did.
We call it <unk> <unk>  <unk> a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We have been able to get a broad range of <unk> from the dark and <unk> to light light and <unk>
In order to print the structures at large scale, it was built a system with multiple <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The robot could vary the properties of the material and create these structures made from a single material that came out -- 100 percent <unk>
So when the pieces are ready to get rid of a natural way to find a natural shape with the water.
So why should we keep designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a little bit of the process of printing it used to contain <unk> <unk> which came up for the first time on the planet does a billion years ago, as we hear <unk>
Along with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, <unk> bacteria genetically engineered bacteria to capture carbon from the atmosphere and make it in <unk>
So for the first time, we've been able to generate structures that make their transition without problems without problems of <unk> and if it comes even more, we have even more <unk>
A <unk> tree, <unk> <unk> <unk>
Working with a natural material -- one of the first forms of life on the planet, with clean water, and with a bit of molecular biology, we've transformed a structure called <unk> of shrimp in an architecture that becomes a <unk>
And here is the best <unk> for objects designed for <unk> jobs in the sea, in the sea, in the water, and put on the ground, they will grow a <unk>
This is for our next exploration using the same principles early early early early early time.
We look at the chance to create clothes to keep life for the <unk>
To do that, we need to pay the bacteria and control their <unk>
So as the <unk> <unk> we did our own website, new forms of life created by <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>
I like to think of the synthetic biology as the <unk> <unk> only that instead of <unk> metals -- <unk> <unk> <unk> new <unk> within a very small <unk>
This field is called <unk> <unk>
<unk> our own <unk> structures to control the flow of these crops -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In our first piece of clothes, it was <unk> two <unk> two <unk>
The first is <unk>
It lives in our oceans and in the <unk> of <unk>
And the second <unk> <unk> the bacteria that we inhabit in the human brain.
So a light becomes the light in the other direction, and it produces more useful for the environment and <unk>
But these two <unk> don't interact in nature.
In fact, it's never <unk>
They are here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of paper.
Think about it as evolution, not by natural selection, but evolution of design.
In order to make these relationships, we have created a single network, which is called <unk> <unk> who will help us do these bacteria and to make it their function of way.
So we started to grow those channels in the human body, and the properties of the amount of material according to <unk>
If we wanted more <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> channels more <unk>
This is <unk> <unk> when it comes to one of the end to another, we go 60 meters away.
This is half of the length of a football, and 10 times more than our <unk> <unk>
And here it is, as a <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> channels with life within the <unk>
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are creatures like <unk> only half is <unk>
What happens if design <unk> the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that would be <unk>
And if we could create a personal <unk> that <unk> our skin tissue, the tissue, the tissue, our <unk> our <unk> our <unk>
Think about this as a form of edit in the way that you think about it.
I call this the <unk> <unk>
So for that, you always have to go back to nature.
So now, you know that a 3D printer uses material in <unk>
They also know that nature doesn't do it.
<unk> <unk>
This <unk> <unk> for example, creates a highly <unk> architecture within which is <unk> in which they <unk>
<unk> <unk> is about this level of <unk>
And it makes it through the combination of two materials, but of two proteins in different <unk>
One acts as a structure, the other is the one or the <unk> and the <unk> of those <unk>
And this happens through <unk>
The silk silk worm first turned into the environment, it creates a <unk> structure and then it begins to <unk> a <unk>
The tension and <unk> the two forces of life, it takes a single <unk>
With the end of understanding how it works -- this complex process -- a little <unk> on the head of a silk worm to the <unk>
We put it in a box with a box with sensors -- and that allowed us to create this cloud of data in three dimensions and visualizing the complex architecture of the <unk>
However, when you put the silk worm on a plane, not within a box, we realized that it would be a <unk> <unk> and still <unk>
So we started to design different cities, different <unk> and we've discovered that the way, the structure of the <unk> is <unk> directly by the environment.
They often <unk> the silk of silk to death inside their <unk> its silk <unk> and they use it in the <unk> industry.
So we saw that designing these <unk> we could take the <unk> silk <unk> not only <unk>
They <unk> <unk> and we could create these things.
So we put this process up to the <unk>
We had a robot called <unk> <unk> and we put ourselves in our <unk>
We knew that the silk worms are growing up faster and <unk> so we use a solar diagram to reveal the distribution of light and heat on the distribution of light and heat in our structure.
So we created holes or <unk> to drop the shutter of light and heat from silk to the <unk>
We were ready to get to the <unk>
We call it <unk> <unk> <unk>
And after <unk> four weeks, four weeks, they were ready to <unk> with us.
We put them down on the bottom of the <unk> and as we <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and life begins again, like us, but much, much more complex than us, but much more quickly.
<unk> Buckminster Fuller said that the tension is the great mystery, and I had to tell you.
By the <unk> silk silk about silk silk -- they give it all this order, their <unk>
And in a bit more than two or three weeks, <unk> <unk> <unk>
In a <unk> <unk> this is also the length of the building.
The <unk> after the <unk> produce 1.5 billion dollars.
So this might be a <unk> for 250 <unk> in the future.
So here are the two views of the world.
A <unk> silk by a <unk> arm, the other full <unk>
If the last <unk> of design of design is to take care of the products and buildings to form an ecology of two materials, designers must bring these two views of the world.
So what makes us a bit of a matter of course, at the beginning.
Here is a new era of design, a new era of creation, which brings us from a inspired design in nature to a physical nature of the design that demands us for the first time that we do in charge of nature.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Raise your hand if you've ever wondered what you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember what age they had when they asked them to do this?
You can do it with <unk>
It has to be <unk>
Now, raise your hand if you ask your hand if you ask them to be <unk>
It has caused some kind of information.
Anything else.
I am someone who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem was that I didn't have any interest, but I had a <unk> but I had <unk>
In school I liked English, the <unk> and the art and the art and the sort of places that I would put in a <unk> called <unk> <unk>
Maybe you've heard of us.
And in general, I like to try and get away from all of you, by having spent a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this room.
But with the time this sense of, this feeling of, this is not a challenge, it comes to <unk>
And I have to <unk>
But then I put me up on another thing, something totally different -- and I would take it into it, and I feel like I would take it and I feel <unk> I have found it, and then again, this point where I start to <unk>
And finally, I want to <unk>
But then I would like to figure out something new and different, and I'd like to go on on that.
This pattern had been a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first was because it wasn't sure about how it was going to convert all this into a different way.
I thought I had to pick one thing, I'm going to take all of my other passions and go to <unk>
The other reason I had so much <unk> was a little more attention.
I was worried that there would be something wrong in this, and something bad in me is not going to be <unk>
I was worried about whether or whether or whether or whether you will, or your own success.
If you can relate my story and these feelings, I would like to ask you something that I would like to have a couple years ago.
And I would ask themselves, where to fix the meaning of bad or <unk> to make things.
I'm going to tell you where it is going to show you where it comes to the society.
The first question is, how do you want to be <unk>
When we have about five years.
And the truth is that nobody knows what to do, to that age, I went to that age.
It's actually a very powerful issue to make sure that the kids are like, <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> or <unk> to be <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
So this question makes us a bit more and more and more and more different ways of different ways -- <unk> high school students who are going to pick in school.
And at some point, what would you want to be <unk>
And it happens to be the nice exercise of before it comes to what it looks like.
Why? Why?
If this matter immortality to the children with what they might be, he doesn't work with everything they might be.
In fact, it does right now, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't answer them with 20 different different things, even though they're very <unk> and say, "Oh, what don't you say but you can't be <unk>
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  and he is <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And this Amy <unk> walked out of a magazine called <unk> <unk> and after a few months.
But most of the kids don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is that they are going to have to be a <unk>
But it's more than that.
The notion of life is very <unk> in our culture.
This is this idea of the fate of the fate or the real idea that every one of us has something to do, for her time in this land, and you have to figure out what it is that is that thing and spend your life to it.
But if you're someone who is not connected to this <unk>
What happens if there's a lot of different issues that are going to change their curiosity and many different things that want to do?
There are no place for someone like one in that way.
And so you can feel <unk>
So you can feel that you don't have a little bit of information.
And I feel that there's something bad with you.
There's nothing bad in you in you in you there are no <unk>
You're a <unk>
A <unk> is someone who is a lot of a lot with a lot with a lot of <unk>
It's a <unk> so you say, "This is a <unk>
And I could help you if you divide in three different ways.
You also can use other terms of the same idea, like <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
During the age of <unk> the ideal was who was okay in multiple <unk>
<unk> <unk> comes to us as <unk> <unk>
It would be any term that you like or you would like or <unk> you.
It seems to me as a kind of humility to a community, and we can't be sure with one <unk>
This is easy to see the <unk> as a limitation or the <unk> that you have to do it.
But what I've learned with people with people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths in this way.
Here are three <unk> <unk> <unk>
Narrator: The synthesis of ideas.
I mean, the combination of two or more fields and creation of something new in the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> their interests at the <unk> visualization of data, and design math and design to the <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> and Rachel <unk> came up with this idea of their <unk> mix of skills and <unk>
The innovation is happening in the <unk>
So in there you have new ideas.
And the <unk> with all their newspapers, you can access to a huge amount of these <unk> points of <unk>
The second <unk> <unk> is <unk> learning, and the second <unk>
And when the <unk> we get older, we're going to do it.
We look at everything we can have in our hands.
We are used to be <unk> because it has been a lot of times in the past, and this means that we have less fear of testing new things and go out of our cities.
Many skills are <unk> to other people, and we build everything that we've learned to every new area that we are going to do so that we don't start with it.
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> and a little <unk>
And as a little girl, you know, an amazing capacity to develop the memory of the whole memory system.
Now, she's the fastest <unk>
Before being in <unk> <unk> it was <unk>
He had to learn the <unk> <unk> <unk> and this ability and this ability to write <unk> to write <unk> to write <unk>
Now, it's a loss of time to ask what you're going to do, even if at the end of the <unk>
It is possible to apply that knowledge into a totally different field of a way that you can't have <unk>
The third <unk> is the <unk> I mean, the ability to compute in any thing that you need in a <unk> situation, <unk>
And <unk> <unk> is sometimes the CEO of videos, which of the pages of pages of pages of pages -- sometimes I'm going to go back and sometimes, Mr. <unk>
It's valuable because it makes a good job, because it makes a good work.
He is even more valuable because it can take a lot of money, depending on the needs of their neighbors.
The <unk> <unk> defines <unk> as the most important ability for development, for decades, in the 21st century.
The economic world changes as rapidly and <unk> which are the individuals and organizations that can <unk> to meet the needs of the market, which really <unk>
<unk> of ideas, fast learning and <unk> three skills where the <unk> are very <unk> and three abilities that they can lose if they're <unk> to reduce their <unk>
As society, we have a great interest in encourage the <unk> to be the same.
We have complex problems -- and right now, and we need to be very creative -- not enough to do in front of them.
Let's say that they are, in their heart <unk>
And I know that they wanted to be <unk> <unk>
It's not <unk> there's nothing bad in you or not.
In fact, some of the best teams are getting out of a <unk> and a <unk>
So the computer can walk into depth and put ideas, and the <unk> it becomes a way of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful <unk>
But we all should design lives and engage with the shape how we are going to get rid of how we're going.
And unfortunately, the <unk> in a lot of the <unk> in a part of them would simply be more like their <unk>
Once I said this, if there is one thing that you can take from this talk, I hope it is this: <unk> <unk> is what it is.
If you look at a heart of heart -- so <unk> for all of the media.
That's where you take the best of it. That's where you do it.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those who you just saw from being one of them in the last 12 minutes, --  I say, <unk> with their <unk>
Take his fear for those <unk> of <unk>
<unk> <unk>
And the <unk> our <unk> and it takes us to a more specific life and a happy life.
And perhaps more importantly, it would be more important to us, and we would do it.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
In <unk> to a woman named <unk> <unk> which led to a <unk> in <unk>
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember even the most basic details of his life.
His doctor was called <unk> <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help be <unk> but <unk> for him until she died in <unk>
After his death, he did a <unk> and they found <unk> and they found brown and <unk> in the brain of a kind that had never seen before.
And the most surprising thing about it.
If you were to have been alive today, we couldn't give it to them more help than <unk> gave them <unk>
<unk> was Dr. <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> the first patient in getting a diagnosis that we now call disease disease.
From <unk> medicine has been a lot of a lot.
They have discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect themselves from the <unk> many treatments for cancer cancer, for HIV, <unk> for HIV, and so much more.
But so it has been done in the treatment of <unk>
I'm a part of a team of scientists who work to find a cure for Alzheimer's from more than a decade.
So I think in this all the time.
Eighty percent of all over the world.
But in 2050, it will change 150 million that, because by the way, we include many of you from a lot of you.
If you wait to live up to 85 years or more, the chance to get Alzheimer's will be almost one of every one of the <unk>
In other words, there is the probability that you go up with Alzheimer's disease, or helping care of a friend or a friend or a friend of <unk>
Now, only in the United States mortality costs 20 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of medical care is spent in the disease disease or <unk>
Now today is the most elegant disease and its cost of five times a year in the year 2050, as the generation of the <unk>
It might be a little bit more than that, but Alzheimer's disease is one of the biggest major challenges and social networks.
But it has made relatively little <unk> to <unk>
Today, one of the first 10 causes of all over the world, Alzheimer's is the only ones that cannot be <unk> or even able to fix their <unk>
We know less than Alzheimer's disease because we have invested less time and money in the research of the <unk>
The U.S. government spend 10 times every year in the cancer research that in cancer in spite of the fact that it costs us more efficient number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is because of a greater cause, the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what time people knows, but it all the world <unk> Alzheimer's is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last few years, all of the last few years -- all scientists have Alzheimer's disease.
We think we will be able to be <unk> in a normal part of the universe.
But you only have to look at a picture of a very healthy brain, with a healthy patient compared to the patient of Alzheimer's disease, to see the real physical ones.
In addition to making a positive loss of memory and abilities the damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's disease, the hope of life and is always <unk>
Remember, Dr. palsy, I found <unk> and <unk> the brown in the brain of <unk> makes a matter of reasons.
For almost a century, we didn't know much about this.
Now today, we know that they're made of <unk>
You can think of a protein molecule as a piece of paper that looks like a <unk>
There are places in the role that are <unk>
And when you look good, these dots are going to end up in your mind.
But sometimes the things come wrong, and some of you are going to be in the United States.
This is that the molecules of protein would be <unk> between yes, forming groups that can form large <unk> and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Parkinson's disease.
We've spent the last 10 years at the University of Cambridge trying to understand how it works.
There are a lot of steps, and the blood of what you look at is complex, like this.
<unk> a wire could do anything.
<unk> the other ones can make the <unk> <unk>
You have to find the right step for it, and then create a drug that makes it <unk>
Until recently, in his biggest part have been a little bit <unk> and we knew the best.
But now there are a diverse group of people, doctors, thousands and thousands of chemicals and <unk> engineers and <unk>
And together, we've been able to identify a critical step in the process. Now it's testing a new type of drugs that create, this step to stop the disease.
I'll show you some of our last <unk>
No one of our laboratory has been seen yet.
So let's look at some videos of what happened to try these drugs in <unk>
So these are the ones that are healthy, and you can see that it comes with <unk>
These <unk> on the other hand, they have a protein molecules that they eat between themselves in humans as human beings.
And you can see that they're clearly <unk>
But by giving our new drugs in a period of time then we see that <unk> and they live in a normal life.
This is just a good idea. But research as this shows that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and <unk>
After <unk> years of <unk> there are hope of what you can do, in the next 10 or 20 years.
But so I would take that hope, to stop Alzheimer's disease, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it is about you -- it's about you.
We have <unk> that Alzheimer's is a disease and that if we do it, we can <unk>
In the case of other disease, patients and their families have <unk> more research and <unk> pressure on governments, and <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
That was essential to move in the treatment of HIV at the end of the time.
Today, we see that same unit to stop the cancer.
But the patients often can't talk about it.
And their families, the survivors of their loved ones day and night, they're often too busy to go back and advocate for the change.
So it really depends on you.
Eighty percent of it is not as much as a human disease.
All the world with a brain has the basis with a brain accident.
Today, there are 40 million patients like <unk> which can't create the change that they need to do for it.
They were going to be talking about them, and to help us get a <unk>
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
<unk> this article in the middle of the New York Times, in January of this year.
For a long time, I would do this.
The article is a <unk> study designed to create love in the lab, and from my own experience in the lab, and from my own experience to <unk> I was a night last year.
So the procedure is quite simple: Two strange <unk> <unk> to get the best questions every time and then both you look at your eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions about for example.
Number <unk> If you could get morning with a quality or ability, which would be a <unk>
Number <unk> When it was the last time that we were at the last time that we were going to get another one.
And <unk>
And we had to get them to <unk> these are the most <unk> and <unk>
Number <unk> <unk> <unk> I really wanted to make sure that you had a couple of questions about him or not, I know very much about this time, and I gave them things that I would just give someone you just <unk>
When I showed me this study about a few years ago, a really interesting thing called me attention, which two of the participants had married six months later and invited all of the laboratory to the <unk>
So it was <unk> about this process of making love, but since then, it was a <unk>
And when I had the time to try this study with someone who I knew not particularly good -- I didn't expect <unk>
But I would argue, and I thought that it was a good story, so the <unk> at the top of the 19th century, a few months ago.
That was made in January, and now it's already <unk> so I guess some of you probably are going to be a <unk>
And the reason I think this is because I think this is because I have done this question, and again, in the last seven months.
And of this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But what we're going to talk about is <unk>
One week before I was giving the article very well.
I had been working in a book, so I had been working in the last few years, so I had to write about my experience in my life.
But a piece of blog, you can get a few hundred <unk> as much, and those were usually my friends from my Facebook friends and I found out that my article in the New York Times, would probably a lot of <unk>
And that was a good deal of attention in a relatively specific relationship to a relatively specific relationship to it.
But as it happens, I had no idea.
The article was taken at the night, and since the end of the night, this happened in the traffic of my head.
And <unk> had already called the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In a month, the article received over eight million dollars, and I was surprised by saying something, so I would be able to tell this kind of attention.
One thing is to encourage the confidence that the confidence that I writing with <unk> <unk> but another thing is to discover that life from an international state has been news -- and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new <unk>
And when people called <unk> or <unk> what they did every day during weeks, they were so very first the same question: We still have <unk>
In fact, when I was doing this talk, I made a quick search for my email with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And several messages came up and several things.
They were from students and journalists and strangers -- like this one.
I was born in radio and <unk>
And I would take a talk and a few years ago to the stage, and you know, where is your <unk>
And I immediately put me up there.
I understand that this is part of the <unk>
If you write about your relationship with your relationship to a international city, you should expect people to sit asking about it.
But I wasn't ready for the <unk>
And the fishermen seemed to be <unk> life on their own.
In fact, the New York Times, a New York Times, for San Francisco, that I would propose the experiences of Congress to try to figure out the study of these different <unk>
So my first reaction to all of this attention was to be very popular.
I said that not all of us who are both building a building with a public perspective.
<unk> pieces of TV, and I would put them from pictures of us two of us two years ago.
I think I was afraid to become the <unk> <unk> of the process of <unk> a range of which I didn't feel at the right time.
And I understand that people don't want to know if the studio was going to know if we really wanted to know if it was really <unk> or is, if it was able to produce love -- not just a lot, but love -- love <unk>
But this was a question that I didn't really feel able to do it.
My relationship was just about a few months ago, and I learned about everything, which people made the wrong question, right?
So how would you know if you could get together or not, and in addition to <unk>
If the answer is, I would do the experience of doing these two questions right now.
Dr. Arthur <unk> He wrote first about these questions in this same study in <unk> and there was the goal of the researcher was not producing love love love as <unk>
Instead of that, I was trying to figure out a lot of cutting-edge students -- using what <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
But the study would be <unk>
The participants would be more familiar with this. Many studies were also used to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- like a small way of creating confidence and interaction between <unk>
They have been used between members of the police and civil community, and they've been used between people of modern political politics combined.
The original version of the story of history, which I took last summer summer -- which <unk> questions with four minutes of visual contact, it was sitting in this movie, but unfortunately it's never possible.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk in a small college in New York City, and after a student came back to me and told me with <unk> <unk> <unk>
He seemed to be <unk>
And I said, "I mean, you want to say that you <unk> from the person who would do it.
Well, he did a <unk>
I think she only wants to be friends.
And I said, but it was the best <unk>
<unk> who would be able to get better to try to try to figure out what's going to be <unk>
<unk> <unk>
So, <unk> <unk>
However, I don't think that it was the answer to him that he gave me the answer that he was <unk>
In fact, I don't think that the answer that none of you is looking at when it comes to my friends.
I found myself with the study for the first time when I was 11 and a half of a very difficult thing.
I had had that relationship since I was 20, which I was like, pretty much my entire life, and he was my first love -- and I had no idea how to live without him.
So I'm going to talk about science.
And it was all that I could find out about the science of love, and I hoped that it could be a certain form of <unk>
I don't know if I realized that at the time, I thought that only for the book that I was doing but in <unk> it seems really <unk>
I thought that if I made it with the knowledge of love I would never have to know so bad and I used to be able to do it.
And all this knowledge has been useful for a or a other way.
I am more patient with love, I'm more <unk> I'm more <unk>
I have more confidence in <unk> which is <unk>
But I can also see some more clearly, and I can tell you that what I look at is sometimes more than I can get me to me.
So what I'm looking at from love is a <unk> not only about being a <unk> today and to be able to go to the <unk> of the person to the person who <unk>
It might be that this is the <unk> which people ask when they wanted to know if we were still alive.
The story that the media told me about 36 questions is that there might be a <unk> for <unk>
It might have a way to convince some of the <unk> <unk> and this is a very important story -- because they love us to feel <unk> but it's also <unk>
But I think when it comes to a love, we're very willing to take the short version of the story.
So the version of the story that we know is that we still have a <unk>
And their content with an answer to an answer to a <unk>
So more than a question, you know, we do more hard questions, questions like, how do you decide who deserves your love and who you are.
So how will you stay <unk> when things are <unk> and how to cut and <unk> and <unk>
So how do you live with the values that inevitably being connected to a <unk> or even more, how you live with the doubt of your <unk>
I don't know the answers to these questions, but I think it's a good beginning to have a more <unk> conversation about what it means to love to.
So if you want the short version of my relationship, it is <unk> a year, and I put a study designed to create love to create love -- we still continue together, and I'm very close to the <unk>
But in love -- it's not the same thing to stay <unk>
<unk> is the <unk>
So at the end of my presentation, my love doesn't work.
They would say, "Well, because we take the choice of it.
And I got a little bit later at the right now, not because it's not true, but because in the moment, there were no such thing as it was supposed to be.
I didn't think a few times we would have to take all of that decision, and that time, I would have to keep doing that choice without knowing whether he always asked me or not.
I want to be enough to have done it, and I would have chosen to have a love to be able to make someone as happy and fun and silly that we paid for that choice in the United States.
But what I've done in change is to convert my relationship into the type of myth where I don't think of it.
And what <unk> and what I would spend my life looking for is that this myth is true.
I mean, the end of the title of my presentation, which is, by the only part of the article that I actually don't know.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to pick someone, and hope that he also loves me, and it's okay but it is <unk> but that is the <unk>
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
I was raised by a number of <unk> in full <unk> and in a certain way I would be like a <unk> of the forest industry.
And the city of New York makes a time --  something that I really loved me but more and more details later on.
I'm going to start with when I was eight years old.
I took a box of wood, and I would take a copy of a <unk> a <unk> and a <unk> in a place in <unk>
And I thought a lot of odd guys or a few copies find this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our species <unk> ideas, by example how we eat the <unk>
I had no idea.
But anyway, it has <unk> because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still doing that.
In a moment I was in <unk> <unk> I like to go to the <unk> and do it and do all those things -- and I was doing a pen for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and started all the pages and I made a kind of <unk> <unk> at the University of New York City.
Well, my mother has afraid of the bees and it's <unk> and so I see more <unk> on the table, thinking that I could <unk>
Instead, it happened to be the end of some way it seemed to be the size of size, as if it was the text with a <unk>
So I went to the most <unk>
So this time, I started looking at some of the strange things that I was finding out on the street, all I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to get out of these <unk>
So I got to draw about the objects, and I realized that God of mine can draw in the space.
I can use it to be able to make sure that it makes it about a body, in the scene of <unk> <unk>
And I put objects and created my own <unk> of individuals -- <unk> <unk> <unk>
First of all, we will be able to make an idea.
And then I did a few insects and creatures that were <unk>
It was very funny to draw in the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building <unk> and those things, and I was paying for some money, to bring my girlfriend to dinner, for example, to go to <unk>
It was great, right?
At some point I was interested in the human shape of a natural way of natural size as human beings within the <unk>
It was great, except for one thing, I would say that it was amazing.
And I didn't know what to do, because I was going to be a <unk>
And I was going to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use it.
I started to draw in the layers of glass, similar to the drawing on a window, then on another window, and another window, and I had all these windows together, which is a <unk>
And this really happened and so I could leave the <unk>
So I did this for years and my work with something very big, which I call <unk> <unk>
For the <unk> I was inspired by a huge measure of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> which is a painting in the Museum of <unk>
What do you do?
Well, it's a picture of it.
They say that it's a little bit too fast to their time.
Well, <unk> <unk> this <unk> <unk>
Three <unk>
<unk> <unk>
It has double face, so it's 10 meters of <unk>
It's a little <unk>
Well, that's the source of blood pressure of the <unk>
On the left is Jesus and <unk> <unk>
There is a cave where all these creatures with all these creatures with two <unk>
You're from the world in the world of <unk> to this <unk> where it comes to <unk> where it is.
So here is where the creatures with animals are getting to the <unk> ready to kill them in the ocean, in the air.
The ocean is made from thousands of dollars.
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is in <unk> <unk> -- the <unk> platform of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- there are all kinds of strange things you can find if you look very well in the ocean right now.
So anyway, a species of <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it's the oil in a hand while the other hand came out of the other.
Their hands are like <unk> and it seems to be the Earth that keeps the Earth and the cosmos in the <unk>
So it's one aspect of the <unk>
It's a little bit <unk>
That's the hand where the hand is <unk>
And then, when you go to the other hand, it has a <unk> like a <unk> <unk> and <unk> of this <unk>
It also has a <unk> <unk> of <unk> which supports the <unk> <unk> which supports <unk>
But anyway, his <unk> <unk> on a <unk> on a <unk>
I don't know why it happened before.
Things that are going to be <unk> you know.
And his tail ends up in a balloon that was made out of <unk>
They have <unk>
They were doing in the 1980s, as if they were out of high school in the <unk> of <unk>
All of the time in the time --  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk> <unk>
This is a project for six years to make 100 of these human beings.
Every one is an archive of our culture, through media and material to be <unk> <unk> or <unk>
But each one acts as a sort of archive of a human being, and they travel in groups, four or 12 at the time.
They are like cells, and they're <unk>
And you can walk between them, and you can walk between them.
Every one is basically an <unk> <unk> which weighs 40 pounds of <unk> with a human brain.
This has a small cave in the <unk>
That is the <unk> it's his chest, it can be <unk> the <unk>
I would say, for the rest of the brain, there's a waterfall that comes out of the chest, and you get the <unk> or <unk> or whatever it is -- a kind of thing.
This is a little bit of these works because I can't <unk> for a long time.
And we can see.
This is a baseball body, because this is a <unk>
This has two feet, and it is communicating between the two of the <unk>
There are a lot of girls who come and go into the head of this book.
There's a small scene in the <unk>
You can see <unk>
But anyway, this talk is about these guys, just like the boxes that we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system.
This brings me to my last little <unk>
It's a box of <unk> It's called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In this box there is a physical physicist, a <unk> <unk> a writer, a writer, an artist, an art, a school, an airplane arm that I <unk> all the content that we do in the room, and a <unk>
And so the box and all the people in each other like this.
And I think that is the way to change the world.
So when you <unk> who is and the box in which it's <unk> it is <unk>
And together we have to realize that we're all together in this, that this illusion that we're different -- these concepts of countries from Europe, from religion, from religion, doesn't work.
We're all very made of the same matter and in the same way.
And if we didn't start to take those things with <unk> and we all are going to die very well.
Thank you. Thank you.
What do you do when you give them the <unk>
They put a <unk>
But so this bag has effect on pain, first about the stomach, the <unk> and the other things.
So a pill is the most effective system and <unk> so that any disease in the body.
Now, the <unk> though, is that the <unk> any drug <unk>
And this is a great problem, especially in patients with <unk>
So when you take drugs -- these are the <unk> of the number of viruses in the blood, and increase the amount of stem cells.
But they're also known for their side effects on their side effects in their <unk> because in the time that they would go to the current supply chain, and worse for the time they could, in the time that it was most important, in the <unk>
And these are regions of the body as the <unk> <unk> the lungs, the lungs, where the virus is <unk> and it's not going to be so easily in the bloodstream, of patients who are going to be able to restore therapy with drugs and <unk>
However, after the treatment of treatment, the virus can take and make new cells <unk>
This is the big problem of HIV with HIV with the human drugs that is a treatment for <unk>
One day, I sat down, and I thought to do the treatment directly to the plant, not the <unk> <unk> of <unk>
As a scientist in <unk> the answer was in front of me -- the <unk> of course.
If you use them in <unk> for <unk> and surgery surgery -- can be used for any <unk> including the <unk> <unk> including the <unk> <unk>
In fact, we're already using laser laser to open or drinking holes extremely small holes where we open up the brain cells with HIV in order to put them with HIV to get the <unk>
So the best thing to say is, "How do you do that?
We put a little bit of laser laser on the genetic membrane of HIV while these cells are embedded in a liquid liquid that contains the <unk>
The laser picks up the cell, whereas the cell will produce the drug in the <unk> of <unk>
Before I even realized the hole is <unk>
We currently are testing this technology in <unk> or on <unk> but the goal is to take this technology into the human body, showing the human body.
What is that <unk> you can see it <unk>
Well, the answer is: through a device about three <unk>
With the first head, that is our <unk> we're going to make a <unk> at the site of <unk>
The second one -- which is a camera on the site of <unk>
Finally, the third one is a <unk> which is <unk> it releases it directly on the site of infection, whereas the laser can use new cells to keep cells out of new cells.
Well, this doesn't seem a lot of time.
But one day, if you have success, this technology can lead to the total rate of HIV in the brain.
Yes. A cure for breast cancer.
This is the dream of all of the <unk> in our case, a treatment with <unk>
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
In the last decade, I've been studying groups of armed groups, not <unk> organizations like terrorists, <unk> or <unk>
<unk> what they do these groups when they're not <unk>
My goal is to understand better than these agents of violence and studying ways of engaging the transition from civil participation to the war in the <unk>
I do work work in the world of politics and in the <unk>
So how many of these groups are key to solve almost everything in course, because the war has changed <unk>
It used to be a <unk> between <unk>
It's not no.
Now it's a conflict between states and women.
For example, from the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> between <unk> and 2011, it was between a state and a half of the <unk>
So we need to understand these <unk> we even need to be <unk> or <unk> in any of the resolution of cultural conflicts in any <unk>
But how does it work?
We have to know what motivates these innovators to do these innovators to do these <unk>
We know very well the reason why we do it, how do they do it, but nobody can do what they do when they don't <unk>
The struggle and political policies are not <unk> it's <unk>
This is part of the same <unk>
We can't understand these groups, not so much less <unk> without a global view of global view.
The armed groups of today are responsible for many, many <unk>
For example, <unk> <unk> known for their foreign communities.
From their creation in the 19th century, <unk> also set up a political game, a social network, a social network and a <unk>
And in the same way, the <unk> <unk> known for their <unk> <unk> against Israel, also <unk> the <unk>
So these groups do more than simply to be <unk>
Thank you very much.
And I would put a complex behavior of <unk> radio stations, some of the Internet channels and strategies in social media.
And here you have the magazine magazine magazine in English, and it took to <unk>
The military groups are also investing in a complex complex <unk> but through business <unk> for example, companies of <unk>
These activities are <unk>
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their <unk> to recruit better and build their <unk>
The armed groups also do something else, they create more strong ties with their population, investing in social services.
They build hospitals, they eat hospitals, they put hospitals, they put them in skeletal muscle programs or <unk>
<unk> allows all these services and more.
The armed groups are also trying to deal with the population, offering something that the state of not <unk> and <unk>
The U.N. percent of the Taliban in a Afghanistan went for war or even the beginning of the <unk> of <unk> it can also make the efforts of these groups of these groups of these groups of these groups of these groups of these groups of these groups of these groups of these groups for survival.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has a <unk> price for developing countries.
But in general, provide social services -- it means to fill a <unk> gap for government, and it allows them to be these groups, and increase their power.
So for example, the CEO of 2006 of <unk> <unk> can't make the social work of the group.
This is a really complex, very complex, even in the West, when we look at the groups, we just think about it.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, the strategy or the vision of the long run.
These groups are <unk> these groups are <unk>
And <unk> because they were eating loans in the government, and they come up like armed groups and politicians, and they would go back to the struggle and give them <unk>
And the more complex and complex are these problems, unless we can do it as something like something else.
How do you ask a group like this.
It was a part of a <unk> <unk> all of the <unk> sudden <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is a <unk>
Or maybe it's another thing, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states, of nations without state and <unk> and the most weak are states, as in the Middle East the Middle East -- and then that gap is <unk>
This is important for governments, because for governments, because to bring these groups are going to invest more in tools in order to improve their lives.
<unk> that war of government has to be at the center of any cultural approach to the center of any cultural approach to the center of any <unk>
This is very important also to establish and to build the <unk>
If we understand better or better groups, we will understand better what incentives are to encourage the transition from violence against violence against violence.
In this new <unk> between states and actors -- the military power can make some <unk> but we don't make peace peace for us.
In order to get these goals together, we need long-term investments to fill that marker out of that village from the U.S. government, which allowed these groups to be able to make these <unk>
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
I am a failure as a woman and as a child.
My opinions about gender equality are <unk> but I'm afraid to take the tag out of the <unk> it would be <unk> for the <unk>
I am a researcher, but quite simply, it's pretty good.
And so I asked him as a bad word.
Or, at least I wrote a <unk> and a book called "The <unk> <unk> and then in the interviews, people started to go to <unk>
So what started as a personal joke as a personal joke to me and a <unk> <unk> has become something more <unk>
Let me give you a step now.
When I was a young girl, about all of my youth and 20 years ago, I had strange ideas about <unk> these women were <unk> these women were <unk> with men and who would be a bad thing.
Now today, I see how the women around the world and anger, in particular, it seems a perfectly reasonable response to a very reasonable problem.
But at that time, I was worried about the tone that I was using people to <unk> that it could be <unk>
It will be known as my father was a word for a word <unk> and <unk> <unk>
And I would argue, as a woman who doesn't still feel the rules, that she wants too long to believe that it is like or top to a <unk>
No one wants to be that woman <unk> until he realizes that it's actually that woman and can't imagine being another person.
With the time, as I went through that I started to accept that I was in fact that I was in fact, and I also wanted to talk about it.
For me, certain things are <unk> women are equal to men.
It would be the same way for the same work.
We have right to travel through the world as a free of <unk> or violence.
We have right to use it in a way and accessible investors and affordable services to <unk>
We have the right to decide about our bodies, not need to <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk>
We have the right to <unk>
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you have to have to have our other <unk>
We're not only women.
We are people with a different body, expression of religion and religion and <unk> sexual services, skills and so much more.
We have to know these differences and how we engage ourselves in the same way that the matter that we have in common.
And this kind of <unk> our feminism is not enough.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be <unk> I'm a <unk>
I'm full of <unk>
There's a lot of things that make me a bad idea.
I have a <unk>
So when you go back to work, I hear music, I hear music about all of those.
Even though the letter connects me to women and <unk> the classic <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> actually with your <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you <unk> the <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> <unk>
I'm totally <unk> by my own <unk>
I believe in the work of the man, which is all that I don't want to do, <unk>                -- but also killing <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
And the <unk> is my <unk>
<unk> of the blind people and the <unk> things -- <unk> <unk>
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and I have dreams, <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk>
Some of my <unk> are more <unk>
If a woman wants to take the <unk> of his husband, it is her choice, and I'm not who <unk> for <unk>
If a woman decides to stay at home to raising their children, they get that choice as well.
The problem is not that it becomes vulnerable as vulnerable to this exact same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> so that women are willing to pay attention when they <unk>
<unk> this problem.
<unk> the conventional <unk> which has failed or <unk> all the needs of the women of color, gay rights and <unk> in favor of <unk> <unk> <unk> of middle class and <unk>
<unk> if that is good news, I'm a very happy feminist teacher.
It also happens to be what happens when I feel a lot of <unk>
We have this trend of <unk> <unk> in a <unk> <unk>
We hope to go to the <unk>
So when we get older, we have a lot of fun from the same <unk> where <unk> <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I'm a <unk> I think <unk> <unk> before you try to get there.
<unk> women, particularly women and leaders are afraid to be <unk> as <unk> as <unk> as <unk> as <unk>
They have fear of their foot and say, "Yes, I am <unk> by fear that it means that <unk> don't be able to deal with the <unk> <unk>
Just to show you a quick example to <unk> or as I call <unk> <unk>
In the last few years it's a feminist feminist <unk>
In the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> in front of the word <unk> of three meters of <unk>
It was a <unk> <unk> looking at this movie star, and to ask women to know women and men and young men who will be my father is something to be <unk>
So the time the time, the cultural critics started <unk> <unk> if they were or not even <unk>
And he would rather be in place to simply believe the word of an independent woman and <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> because we are still struggling for a lot, we want a lot, we need a lot of <unk>
We're much more there than the critical success and <unk> for <unk> the <unk> of any woman, <unk> until it's not enough.
We don't need to do that.
The bad news, or more well, a <unk> <unk> is the point of view.
But what does it mean?
We go to recognize our <unk> to give us the action and be a little bit more <unk>
And if I hear music, I am creating a demand for artists that would be more happy than happy to provide a <unk> supply of a <unk> supply of <unk>
So these artists don't make their way to talk about women in their songs until we get the change affecting their ancestors in the United States.
It certainly is hard.
Why does her music be so <unk>
It's hard to pick something better and so easy and so easy to make a better <unk>
But when the bad bad decisions do this, this makes it more difficult for women to achieve equality, equality that all of us, and it's our <unk>
I think in my <unk> three and four years.
These are two girls <unk> <unk> and <unk> and also very <unk> I want you to do it in a world where you have in a world world.
And where are we going to do it for the strong creatures they are.
I think in them, suddenly, the best option will be <unk> like something much easier to do.
We all can make better decisions.
We can change the marketplace, when a television program is about sexual violence against women as well as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We can change the business of radio when we hear songs that try songs like this.
We can spend our money to go to school in another part when movies are not going to the women who like <unk> <unk> objects like <unk>
We can leave them with support of medical sports where corporations are trying to make their peers like this.
In any case, the men, especially American men can say, "No, I'm not going to put in your magazine to get in his project, or to work with you, until it's not only a number of women, so to be a number of women, so to be a number of people.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization will be more <unk> with a larger range of <unk>
Those of us who are <unk> but we will be able to participate in this kind of projects, we also can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be <unk> to overcome the barriers to the ones that are <unk>
So we are not <unk> <unk> Without these efforts, without doing these <unk> our achievements are going to mean very <unk>
We can do these little <unk> and wait for them, and wait for our decisions to get the people in the power and producers of cinema and music, <unk> <unk> the people who can take big decisions and make sure that they can make a <unk> change and improve their lives.
We also can ask them to help us understand our poem, well, or of any <unk>
The last line of my book, <unk> <unk> says to be a bad secret to not be a <unk>
This is true because of a lot of reasons, but I say I say, about everything, because I was born my voice and my voice was <unk>
There was a <unk>
And I call it <unk> to make sure that country.
A few kids asked me when I was very young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a <unk>
They tried to do it as well.
I started to believe that it wasn't anything.
<unk> my voice, and after all of them I don't know that I could say something that I could do before.
But I was <unk>
And with that, I went to <unk>
I would put them in a very strong version of me all.
And the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and of the women who seemed to me and understood what it meant to live in this world if you have the skin <unk>
And the words of women who showed me that it wasn't anything.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned to write like me all.
I found my voice, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can do with what you can do.
Through writing and <unk> I also discovered that if it was a little <unk> another woman might be <unk> and I realized that none of us is the thing that the world is going to tell you that we are.
In a hand, I have the power to achieve any thing.
And in the other I make the reality of what I'm just going to tell you about what I am just talking about.
I'm a bad person, I'm a good person, I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way of thinking, what I say and what I do, without all of what makes me.
I hope we all can do it.
I hope that all we can be a little girl, when you want to be a <unk>
Just after Christmas, last year, <unk> children in California, they had to be able to have <unk> or by being able to be exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus then came out with the border with a more 100 children in <unk>
One of the things that the <unk> of this outbreak is that the <unk> which can be prime for a child with a child mortality system is one of the most effective diseases in the world.
There's an effective vaccine against this since the middle of the 20th century, but a lot of the kids involved in the outbreak of <unk> they didn't have been <unk> because their parents had fear of something being <unk>
But a moment, it was not the article that the discovery of autism, and the vaccines were going to be a <unk> <unk> by being a <unk> <unk> by the mayor of <unk>
It doesn't believe most of the smart scientists that the vaccines have autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know, but millions of parents across the world are going to be <unk> that vaccines are in danger to their children in their own lives.
Why? Why?
So here's why.
This is a graph of the increase in the time.
Over the most part of the 20th century, though, it was a very powerful disease.
The few psychologists and <unk> who had heard of it, they would be able to develop all their professional life without seeing a single case.
For decades, the estimates of prevalence followed so only three or four children for every 10 <unk>
But then, in the 1970s, the numbers started to <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> as a <unk> as if it could be <unk> of another child in <unk>
What is it?"
If you are not the <unk> what you're going to do, what is it?
If you ask people of the <unk> of <unk> of course, what is going on, tend to be based on sentences like <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> to explain these numbers <unk> to explain these numbers <unk>
But that kind of language of language, a lot of the fears of a young mother who look at the face of his son in the face of two years old.
If the judges have that diagnosis, why were they as <unk> as they were as <unk>
Why were the cases of autism, so hard to find out before the decade of <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened is that what happened is that the slow progress and the <unk> of science that with the power of <unk>
Over the most part of the 20th century, the doctors told a story about what autism and how it was, but that story turned out to be <unk> and the consequences of the same are having a critical impact on public public health care in public public public public health.
There was a second story more much more accurate history of autism, which had lost and forgotten in the dark parts of the literature today.
So this second story tells us all about how we get here and where we have to go back.
So the first story starts with a psychiatrist named <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> In <unk> <unk> published an article that describes 11 patients who seemed to be <unk> worlds to people of their own kids.
You might know that for hours to take the hands of their faces, but they were <unk> <unk> as when they didn't put their favorite toy in their favorite toy in their own way.
On the basis of the patients treated in their <unk> <unk> <unk> that autism is very different.
For the last decade as a major authority of the world in the world, he had seen less than 150 percent of their species as well as <unk> <unk> as a <unk>
So this is actually not about laughter, because the <unk> <unk> for autism were very <unk>
For example, <unk> giving that diagnosis to be that diagnosis, but now we know that <unk> is very common in society.
Once the one that he had become nine percent of every 10 children sold for other doctors to their doctor's office to be a lawyer without giving a diagnosis of it.
<unk> was a smart, but part of their theories were not <unk>
They would take care as a way of paying attention.
So these kids, he said, "You know, they've got a little bit carefully at a <unk> who don't <unk>
At the same time, though, I noticed that some of their young patients had special skills that we could, in certain areas like the music, the mathematics and memory and space.
One of the children in their clinic might be in the clinic for 18 years before the two years.
When her mother put one of his favorite mathematics, he summed up he said, <unk> <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these abilities explaining things like the children were simply <unk> what they had heard of their parents <unk> desperate to win their <unk>
So as a result, autism became true of shame for families, and two generations of children were sent to institutions for their own well, and it became invisible to the world in general.
And secondly, it wasn't until the researchers started to test the theory of <unk> that autism was different.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of London -- I thought the theory of mothers -- it was pretty <unk>
She and his husband came up and she was <unk> and they had a deep child called <unk> <unk>
And John <unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a girl like <unk> without sexual services without special education, not access to other resources without a <unk>
By the end of the National Science Foundation that they were needed more resources for children and their families, and their families, and their colleague of mine had decided to do something that would be done for 30 years before.
It was a study of autism in the general population of autism in the <unk>
And I went back to a New York called <unk> to try to find the children in the community.
What you saw was that the <unk> model was too <unk> because the reality of autism was much more <unk> and <unk>
Some kids couldn't talk about it, whereas other people were <unk> in their fascination with the <unk> in the <unk> in the <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>
In another way, these kids don't <unk> in some <unk> and <unk> as he said, and you saw a lot of them, so much more than the <unk> <unk> <unk> would have <unk>
At first, they were killed by trying to make sense to their data, and at the first time they were born.
How no one had no <unk> of these kids to do this?
But then <unk> found a reference to an article published in German in <unk> in <unk> the next year to the <unk> of <unk> and that then <unk> out under the <unk> of a terrible time that nobody wanted to.
<unk> I knew about this article in this article in the <unk> but <unk> <unk>
I didn't even have a translation of English, but luckily, the husband of <unk> was talking about <unk> and he said to him, and he did.
The document is an alternative story of what makes us an alternative story.
So his author was a man named Hans <unk> who was an integrated clinic with a <unk> in the United States.
The ideas of <unk> for teaching children with physical differences were <unk> even for the <unk> standards, even for <unk>
The afternoon, in their clinic started with some type of clothing with music, and the kids followed their games at the top of it.
Instead of afraid of the parents of causing autism, but he described as disability as being <unk> of life that required <unk> forms of support and spaces for the course of all life.
Instead of trying to go to the children in their clinic as patients, and I call them their little teachers, and they can also help help help find the development of education that were especially left for them.
And he saw autism as a diverse continuum that was a remarkable variety of <unk> and <unk>
He believed that autism, and the traits that were common were common and always have been, looking at aspects of this continuum in <unk> in the <unk> culture, and the teacher <unk> and Professor <unk>
He was beyond that until I say that for success in science and art, a little bit of autism is a <unk>
<unk> and <unk> found that <unk> was wrong in which autism was <unk> so the parents were <unk> so the parents were <unk>
In the next few years, I worked in silence with the American Association of <unk> to expand the criteria of diagnosis, which <unk> the diversity of what they called <unk>
At the end of the 80 and early '90s -- their changes in <unk> and the <unk> model of <unk> for one broad <unk> of <unk>
So these changes not <unk> in <unk>
<unk> when <unk> and <unk> were working between the <unk> of these <unk> people around the world would see an adult adult for the first time.
Before I went back to <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a little bit of a little <unk> <unk> for experts who would know what the autism, but after the <unk> <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> with four <unk> of <unk>
At the same time, it was released at the same time, and the first clinical trials that we use to diagnose the disease.
And I didn't have a connection with that small circle of experts to get a diagnosis for her son, for her mother.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes in the things, and the introduction of these trials created an effect effect of the network, a perfect <unk> of the consciousness of it.
So the number of research started to <unk> as we could, as we predicted <unk> and <unk> in fact they were hoping that it was so excited that the people with autism and their families finally <unk> the support and services that were <unk>
So Andrew <unk> came to blame the vaccines for the rise of the Sun, a very powerful simple thing and <unk> history -- as bad as the theory of <unk> that autism was <unk>
If the dominant majority of the heart rate that one of every <unk> children in the United States are in the corner, is right now, the ones are one of the biggest groups of the world.
In the last few years, the people who have moved into the Internet to make the idea that they are the ones that are going to solve for new breakthroughs -- the term <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate the <unk>
One way to understand <unk> is to think about terms of human nature.
The fact that a guy can't work with it, it doesn't mean that it is <unk> it doesn't mean that it's <unk>
According to the standards, the normal human brain is easily <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk>
